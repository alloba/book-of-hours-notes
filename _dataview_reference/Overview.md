Dataview is a live index and query engine for the vault. It is able to scan for metadata that you add to notes, and render out queries to view. Meaning you can get a bit dynamic with things. 

Significantly, it really needs you to get into the habit of annotating notes to get proper use out of it. So do that. 

Something that is kind of a bummer but it also makes sense - Dataview is all about rendering and viewing data, NOT editing. So shelve your dreams of performing clever edits in bulk to your notes. Although I do still want that.
