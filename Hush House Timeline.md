# Dawn Period
599? -> ?. [[Dawn Period]]

599 AD is traditionally the date of the first foundation on the Isle, but the timeline is murky. The Sisterhood of the Triple knot built their first templates much earlier. 

# Solar Gothic Period
11th century -> 16th century.  [[Solar Gothic Period]]

During this time the sisters and brothers of [[St Brandan's]] dwelt on the Isle. 
In 1534 the Bronze King Henry dissolved the foundation, exiled the brethren, and gave the Isle to the family Dewulf.

- 1230 - 1350 
	- An endowment was given to the abbey by Eva de Braose, which enables expansion projects. 
	- The Winter Tower is constructed, and dedicated to the Madrugad
	- Abbess Nonna dies, 'by poisoning and Arts unsanctioned'. This causes the monastery to be reformed to only accept male novices. (1349) 

# Baronial Period
16th century -> 1759. This time period had the Dewulf family governing the Isle as the Barons Brancrug, and was ended by a tragic death of their family line. 

# Curia Period
18th century -> 1896. [[Curia Period]]
A secretive cabal of scholars establish the 'Curia of the Isle' to manage Hush House, making it a haven of knowledge. 

- ? - [[world-at-large/Thirza Blake|Thirza Blake]] brings the House to penury, causing a change in power on the Isle as a result. 


# Nocturnal Period
1896 -> 1932. [[Nocturnal Period]]
A previous librarian's ([[world-at-large/Thirza Blake|Thirza Blake]]) enthusiasms sunk Hush House into great debt. The Suppression Bureau stepped in and offered funding. In exchange, Hush House underwent yearly inspections, and gave a portion of the Isle for the Branch's prison. 

- 1915 - The Suppression Bureau has the bells "Shur's Tongue" and "Janice" recast, as a repayment of a favor rendered by Serena Blackwood. 
- 1929 - A great fire runs through the gaol of Hull House. The fire was caused by the power below the prison, escaped from the [[Oubliette Containment]]. This caused the death of [[George Collers]], and marks the end of the Suppression Bureau's presence on the Isle, as well as the end of the Nocturnal period. 
# Present Day

>March 7th, 1936 - There has been no Librarian at Hush House since the fire - seven years now. Suitable candidates are very difficult to find, but perhaps we have found one in you. Take care on  your journey - the seas around Brancrug are treacherous.

- 1930 - The Restoration takes place. The violent methods employed by the New King's agents in search of his enemies generated much animosity in Brancrug Village. 
- [[The Librarian]] has washed up upon the shore of [[Saint Brandan's Cove]]. They have arrived after weathering a fierce storm, and have only [[A Drowned Book]] with them.
