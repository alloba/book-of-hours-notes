# Serve Here

## Description

## Info
A place to divvy out servings of beverages. Things tend to come in bottles, and you can make equal use of them by pouring a smaller portion. 

## Locations
-  [[Keeper's Lodge]] - ditto
- [[Kitchen]] - Plates, cups and glasses, so that if I want to offer someone wine, I needn't give them the whole bottle.
- [[Gaol Hall]] - ditto
