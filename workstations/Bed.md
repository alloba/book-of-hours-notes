# Bed

## Description

### Guest Bed: Lodge
Guest Bed: Lodge

Stout, rustic, snug.  [Use a matching Soul card to move your belongings in and make this your bed; or place a matching Visitor card to encourage them to stay a little longer.]

## Info

Several beds exist throughout Hull House. Add a soul card to sleep in one, or add a visitor card to offer them a place to stay for the night. 

Beds can be used to recover fatigued soul cards, and recover from maladies if other appropriate materials are provided.
