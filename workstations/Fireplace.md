# Fireplace

## Description


## Info

There are a number of fireplaces available throughout [[Hush House]]. They can be used for brewing and for burning. 

Locations: 
- [[Keeper's Lodge]] - Fire always accepts gifts. And boils the kettle for tea.
- [[Entrance Hall]] - Visitors found the warmth welcome after the battering winds of the bridge crossing.
- [[Long Tower - Solomon's Study]] - The fireplace doesn't exactly warm the room, but it keeps the chill more or less at bay.
- [[Infirmary]] - A welcome warmth.
- [[Hall of Division]] - The firelight reflections in the mirrors are difficult to describe without risking a foray into pentameter.
