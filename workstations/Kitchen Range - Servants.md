# Kitchen Range - Servants

## Description
Kitchen Range: Servants

It's good luck for the villagers to bring little gifts of food to the Librarian. That's already become a tradition. But sometimes the Librarian wants a hot meal, and, these days, the Librarian is the only entity in the house that can cook.
