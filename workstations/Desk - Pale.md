# Desk - Pale

## Description
Desk: Pale

Solomon Husher himself commissioned this from Lockwood Fen bog-yew, blackened and half-fossilised by centuries underwater. Here at this desk he wrote his doomy allegory of Winter and its romance with the sun. When he blotted the last word on his manuscript and rose from his work, the timber had turned pale as fresh-cut maple. Or so the story goes.
