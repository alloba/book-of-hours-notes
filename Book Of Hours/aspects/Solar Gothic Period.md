# Solar Gothic Period

## Description
Solar Gothic Period

From the 11th to the early 16th Century, the sisters and brothers of [[St Brandan's]] dwelt on the Isle. It was a holy place, a wealthy place, and a centre of learning - though a surprisingly obscure one. Then in 1534, the [[King Henry VIII|Bronze King]] Henry dissolved the foundation, exiled the brethren, and gave the Isle to the family Dewulf.
