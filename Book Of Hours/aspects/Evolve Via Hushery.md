# Evolve Via Hushery

## Description
Evolve via Hushery

I could use Hushery here to evolve my Soul. [Once you've committed a skill to the Hushery Wisdom, you can use that skill here to combine two identical Soul cards into a greater one. But you must use a skill you've attuned to that Wisdom, and it'll only work once.]
