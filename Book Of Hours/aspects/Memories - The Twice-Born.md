# Memories - The Twice-Born

## Description
Memories: the Twice-Born

'I remember that I once walked the [[World/The Mansus|House of the Sun]] as a bodiless immortal; but there was a matter that could only be resolved if I returned to flesh. Now, if I go back to the House of the Sun, I will be hunted and punished; if I stay in flesh, I will be hunted and devoured. I need a third choice. To remain at Hush House, as Librarian, would be one such choice. But there might be something more.'
