# Serpents & Venoms

## Description
Serpents & Venoms

These are the Mother's neglected children, and we prefer that they pass not through any door.

### Hushery I
The Last Sun

In the dawn times the sun was lower, so we gave it our blood. From our blood it knew us, and so it was kinder. Its serpents brought us its poisons to drink, and so we died. But we only died a little, and so we dreamed, and returned the next day to give it our blood again. Those times of peace persist in the lessons of Hushery.
