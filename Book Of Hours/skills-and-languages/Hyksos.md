# Hyksos

## Description
Hyksos

The Shepherd-Kings brought this speech west from Canaan to use in their wards and snares. Had they never come to Egypt, they might never found a way to write it; given its addictive qualities, that might have been for the best.

### Nyctodromy I
The Watchmen

The veterans of the LÃ©gion du Seuil, who guard the boundaries of the waking world, tell stories of the labyrinths under the Mansus, above the Wood, and inside the Moon, where the first fallen Hours sleep, or hide, or rot: the gods-from-stone. Why the labyrinths? Because, the legionnaires say, there are Hours ruling now who would fight to consume the last scraps of their old enemies; and those who feast would eclipse those who abstain. The legionnaires have been known to boast that if they were only offered a great enough prize, they could guide the hungry Hours to their feast.
