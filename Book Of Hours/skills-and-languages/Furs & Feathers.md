### The Bosk I
The Well in the Wood

When the first hunters were starving in the Wood, in the days before its darkening, they found a deep and crimson well. In it they drowned the beasts of the earth, so that the beasts would be reborn threefold, and the hunters could feast. So the Red Grail came to be, and so ever since she feeds us and she feeds upon us. This, the Matriarchs of the Knot have taught us.
