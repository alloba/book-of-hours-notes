# Edicts Inviolable

## Description
Edicts Inviolable

The precepts of occlusion and dissolution; their jealous enforcement is the nature of the Calyptra
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Preservation II
Night

[[The Velvet]] is not the oldest Hour; but she is the oldest Hour of Calyptra. The Black Flower on the Watchman's Tree is the preservation of secrets, and without it the Tree would fall. This is a matter of Preservation.
