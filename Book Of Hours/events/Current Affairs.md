# Description
Current Affairs

What's happening in the world beyond Brancrug? What visitors will the season bring?

 [We'll either draw a new Incident; find a suitable Visitor for the current Incident; or retire the current Incident if there are no visitors left for it.]
# Info
Occasionally a new incident and visitor will show up at Hush House. You can discuss incidents with visitors, offer them a consultation, or learn from them if they have a desirable skill (and you have desirable currency).
