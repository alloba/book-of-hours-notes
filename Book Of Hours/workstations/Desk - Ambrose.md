# Desk - Ambrose

## Description
Desk: Ambrose

Ambrose did most of his work downstairs in the foundry and kitchen, or upstairs in the laboratory that later became the Fludd Gallery, but it was at this desk that he composed 'The Temptations of Architecture' and wrote long cross letters to the Times about the flaws of the British constitution.
