# Pumps - Lower Level

## Description
Pumps: Lower Level

These machines are of different and newer manufacture than the ones above. They include something like a generator, too. But they're in even worse condition. I'll need to provide materials and fuel - and I'll need Scholar-level of Forge to jury-rig them.
