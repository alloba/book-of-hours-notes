# Behind the Scenes

## Description
Behind the Scenes

The Curia of the Isle is long gone. Once, it helped preserve a little knowledge and a kind of safety here in Brancrug - and established the position of Librarian. Rowena, Secretary Persistent of the Curia, a complex entity who has long protected Hush House, is both exhausted and compromised... and so it's time for the Librarian to return the favour, and establish a successor to the Curia. [Help Visitors to pursue their goals and develop their Agendas. When you've found six suitable candidates inspired by Agendas, you can suggest they found an organisation that's a worthy successor to the Curia of the Isle. If you cannot find a suitable Secretary Persistent, Rowena will continue to serve in that role, even as she continues to wane.]
