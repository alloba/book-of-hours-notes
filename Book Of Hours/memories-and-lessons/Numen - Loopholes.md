# Numen - Loopholes

## Description
Numen: Loopholes

When [[Eternity]] came into the world, certain prudent powers arranged loopholes: the [[House of the Moon]], the persistence of possibility, the right to vengeance. In the right Histories, those loopholes will open again... [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Twice-Born can win a particular victory.]
