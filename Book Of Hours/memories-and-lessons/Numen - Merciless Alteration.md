# Numen - Merciless Alteration

## Description
Numen: Merciless Alteration

The fundamental flaw; the irresistible shortcut; the hate that heats; the change that mars; the scar that opens. These are the foulest Histories.  [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Artist and the Archaeologist can win a particular victory.]
