# Numen - A Final Understanding

## Description
Numen: a Final Understanding

Eternity and History cannot be reconciled. Freedom cannot be perfection - not unless we understand the paradox of the eternal ending. And only in certain Histories is that paradox possible... [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Magnate can use it to win a particular victory.]
