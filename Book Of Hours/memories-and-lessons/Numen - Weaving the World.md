# Numen - Weaving the World

## Description
Numen: Weaving the World

The Histories, they say, are braided like hair - or tangled like roots. What is the shape of that knot? Funny you should askâ€¦  [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Symurgist and the Cartographer can win a particular victory.]
