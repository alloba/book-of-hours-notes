# Numen - Inescapable Confinement

## Description
Numen: Inescapable Confinement

Everything ultimately comes down to a choice between Eternity and History. There's only one place you're safe from both, and it's not a place anyone would want to be. It's a prison that can only exist in certain Histories...  [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Prodigal and the Archaeologist  can win a particular victory.]
