# Earth-Sign

## Description
Earth-Sign

'In the Tracks of Beasts, in the Convolutions of his own Carapace, in Egg-vein and Shell-shadow, the Many-Eyed One found the Signs which can be History.' An Earth-Sign is an auspice traced on the cloaked shape of the earth, perceptible to the sensitive, interpreted only by the wise.
