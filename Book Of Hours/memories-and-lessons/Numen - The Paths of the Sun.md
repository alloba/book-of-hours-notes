# Numen - The Paths of the Sun

## Description
Numen: the Paths of the Sun

The Sun has charted his Paths - paths beyond walls and woods and Bounds. When the Sun lights our way, when we are ready, all of us will enter Eternity - at least, in the right History... [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Cartographer and the Twice-Born can win a particular victory.]
