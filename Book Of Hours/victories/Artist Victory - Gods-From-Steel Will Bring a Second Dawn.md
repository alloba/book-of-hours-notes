# Pre-Craft
Artist Victory: Gods-from-Steel Will Bring a Second Dawn

New Hours! It's a risk. It's almost a cheat. But it'll be all the colours and more. [When the Librarian records a History, even the Hours take note. Making this decision cannot be reversed; it will begin the end game.]

# Post-Craft
Artist Victory: Gods-from-Steel Will Bring a Second Dawn

It is written. [You have recorded a new History. Bring it to Earl Brian's Field in the season of Numa, and the Hours will bear witness.]

# Pre-Submit
Call for my History to be witnessed

'Earth, sky, sea: bear witness to my work. [You've wrought a History which at least one of the Hours will endorse. This is the point of no return. Many of these Histories are strange or wild. Unless you're certain you want to end the game, remain here in the peace of the House.]

# Artist Victory: All the Colours, and More
[[King Henry IX|The New King]]'s foundries and glassworks roar with light. I begged a visit. I wasn't disappointed. I can see the colours of Eternity in those fires. Those colours will kind a hundred windows. Dawn will come All I have to do is make _absolutely certain_ that my part in it is known. 

[You have proved yourself as Librarian; convinced the Hours to accept a History; changed the world; won the game. This is the memory that does not die. Please accept our congratulations!]
