# Dr Arun Peel
## Description
Dr Arun Peel

Exile, riddlemonger, [[Thunderskin]] devotee. ('I'd rather say confidant'). Impeccably dressed, but always in dark clothing so the stains don't show. Dark the dressings too at his ankles and his wrists. ('I won't take a seat. It's kind of you to offer. It would be unkind of me to accept.') 

Mailing address Kardia House, Chania, Crete
