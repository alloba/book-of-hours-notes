# Dr Serena Blackwood
## Description
Dr Serena Blackwood

One-time Librarian of Hush House, one-time Librarian of the Invisible Serapeum in Alexandria, and currently... what, exactly? Serena is close-mouthed, but I know that she has worked with the [[St Rhonwen's Trust]].
## Info

Not a great amount of detail is known about her through records, although she is known to have assisted [[Christopher Illopoly]] by preparing him a space at Hush House, as well as [[George Collers]] with his clock project. Although, she perhaps came to regret dealing with the latter.
