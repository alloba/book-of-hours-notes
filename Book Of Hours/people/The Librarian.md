The Librarian is the main character of the game. The Twelfth Librarian of [[Hush House]].

They washed up on the shore near [[Brancrug Village]] around 1936 after a terrible storm, with scattered memories of a [[Memory - Storm|storm]] and a [[A Drowned Book]] being the only things in their possession. 

The Librarian gained their title due to a job offer sent from [[St Rhonwen's Trust]], although their reasons for taking the job are personal. 
(Motivations change depending on actions taken at the start of the game)

# Motivations
The Librarian can have one of several ultimate objectives that caused their arrival to [[Hush House]] - when recovering aspects of the soul at the beginning of the game, the combination taken is what determines the outcome.
