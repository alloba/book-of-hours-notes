# Iotic Essence

## Description
Iotic Essence

'In the later operations of the Forge, the [[Madrugad]] yields to the true Forge of Days, and the essence begins to redden.' The bit about the 'true Forge of Days' nearly got her burned for heresy, but no-one ever said she was wrong about the second part.
