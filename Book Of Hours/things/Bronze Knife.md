# Bronze Knife

## Description
Bronze Knife

A long knife of age-darkened metal with a teak handle inlaid with bone. It could be a hunting knife, although it's certainly no older than the nineteenth century, and it's not clear why anyone might have chosen to make a hunting knife out of bronze in the nineteenth century.
