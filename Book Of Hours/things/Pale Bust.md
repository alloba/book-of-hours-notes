# Pale Bust

## Description
Pale Bust

A delicate-featured young (?) woman. An inscription reads [[ABRA SOUTHEY]].

Inspection: 
> _The bust bears a slight but definite resemblance to the many depictions of the notorious [[Eva Dewulf]]. But surely Eva bore only a son, and her grand-daughters died young._
