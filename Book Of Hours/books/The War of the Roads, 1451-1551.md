# The War of the Roads, 1451-1551

## Description
The War of the Roads, 1451-1551

Willis-Ford describes [[the War of the Roads]], an event in a History other than our own, in detail - from its beginnings as a martial-philosophical dispute between the Dawn and Sunset Roads of alchemy, to a war which ravaged half of Europe.

It is not now widely believed that the sons and daughters of the Red Rose were forged into immortals. Understandably: they are, after all, now all long dead. The Forge itself devoured the greatest among them.'

The royalty of England, according to Willis-Ford, became the Sovereigns of [[the Leashed Flame]], destroying or transforming their enemies, conquering Europe, establishing grand cathedrals to St Spark. The alliance with the Forge begins to take its toll. At last, the Bronze King undergoes his 'Great Misfortune' and 'Great Debasement', and is afterwards known as the Copper King. His attempt to cheat the Forge ends badly, [[the Leashed Flame]] is released, and the King's heirs are merely mortal sovereigns.
