# On Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies

## Description
On Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies

[[Fionna Ayrshire]] recounts her visits in dreams to the 'Red Church' in [[World/The Mansus|the Mansus]], and her conversations with the Names of the Grail.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

An Hour, Ayrshire explains, may usually only have seven Names - but since the Thirstlies, Ivories and Lovelies who usually comprise the Red Grail's Names are constantly attempting to devour one another, and the Names of other Hours, that number fluctuates.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Lovelies, the 'freshest' of the Grail's Names, usually adopt the characteristics of whatever they devour - be it an Ivory, a Thirstly, or, occasionally, an entirely different kind of Name. A practical application of the principle is described. The arts of Resurgences and Emergences, in the presence of sufficiently potent Grail-aspect, can be used to feed a [[Pale Mommet]] to its successor-doll, creating something 'notably more avid'.
