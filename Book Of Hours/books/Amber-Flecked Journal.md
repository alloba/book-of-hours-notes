# Amber-Flecked Journal

## Description
Amber-Flecked Journal

	I am the Twice-Born Librarian of Hush House, and this is the journal in which I keep my remaining memories. [The Twiceborn's 'third choice' might be life as the Librarian, or it might be something more radical. But you can complete the game by recording any History. You might wish to begin your studies with the Illumination Wisdom.]
