# The Wonderful Shape

## Description
The Wonderful Shape

Blessings and invocations of the [[Sisterhood of the Triple Knot|Triple Knot]] recorded at a sanctuary in Cyprus notable for its weavers, sculptors, and gardeners.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

'The roots go deep. The knots remainâ€¦'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The final invocation is one for the 'Restoration of the Roots', to be spoken before an altar of the Triple Knot - but, puzzlingly, it should not be spoken by any priestess of the Knot, or even by one who has been initiated into their Mysteries.
