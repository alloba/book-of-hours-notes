# A Journey to the Grove

## Description
A Journey to the Grove

[[Black Elie]], who much later became Damascene Matriarch of the [[Sisterhood of the Triple Knot]], recounts her journey to the Grove of Green Immortals.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

In the Grove, Elie meets with an entity identified as 'Three Faces, Nine Colours' - who may have become her lover.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Three Faces is a Name of the Applebright, the Nowhere Hour of youth, healing and mutation. It offers Elie a form of eternal youth to take back West with her, which she rejects for certain reasons. She does promise, however, to renew their acquaintance 'in the season when the Applebright is the Witch' - not from sentiment, but rather grandly, to ensure the continuity of the Histories.
