# Silver-Bound Journal

## Description

Silver-Bound Journal

I was rich; but something was missing. I am no longer rich... and still, something is missing. Hush House is a place of conclusions, and here, as Librarian, I may find mine. [The Magnate came to the House to conclude a History where they will find peace; but you can complete the game by recording any History. You might wish to begin your studies with the Hushery Wisdom.]
