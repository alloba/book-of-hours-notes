# The Encircling Tantra

## Description
The Encircling Tantra

The explorer and entrepreneur T. Everett Duplantis once attempted to plunder the temple where this text was held. His fate is recorded in an appendix.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The Encircling Tantra speaks of the [[Serpent Gate]], that hungry portal sometimes known as the [[Serpent Gate|Spider's Door]], which is sacred to the [[Mother of Ants]], through which the [[Great Hooded Princes]] pass. 
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The tantra includes an invocation but cautions, helpfully, that the invocation is of insufficient power to reach the Serpent Gate from the [[Hunter's Gate]]. 'A road which has no destination is itself a destination,' it adds helpfully.
