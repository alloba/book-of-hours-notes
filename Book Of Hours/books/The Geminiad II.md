# The Geminiad II

## Description
The Geminiad ii

A fragile manuscript, illuminated with twinned shapes of sad and luminous beauty, and with all the phases of the moon. It might be as old as the seventh century, but the language - Fucine - is much older. The cover is a dark and exotic leather with a smooth, almost chitinous surface, decorated with jasper.
