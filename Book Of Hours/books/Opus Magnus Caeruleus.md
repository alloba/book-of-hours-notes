# Opus Magnus Caeruleus

## Description
Opus Magnus Caeruleus

[[Ambrose Westcott]] used to render the title of this venerable and anonymous work mockingly as 'the Big Blue Business'. A kinder translation would be 'the Great Work in Azure'.
### Partial Study Description

The reasons for Westcott's enmity to this work are clear to any pyroglyphicist: it was written at least two centuries before he was born, but anticipates or undermines many of his preferred conclusions.

The 'Work' in question is the creation of the 'blue gold' allegedly necessary for the terrible Rite which allows a Forge-long to become a Name. The book mentions that Pyroglyphics techniques can be used with Forge to create Iotic Essence as a necessary component; but withholds the final step, insisting that the consequences are too dire, and that any interest should remain only a matter of theory.
