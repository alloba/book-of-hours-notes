# Experiment Beyond Sight

## Description
EXPERIMENT BEYOND SIGHT

Ilse Bischoff's bewildering, widely derided final film.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The film is an unrelenting fusillade of apparently unrelated images - birth, mirrors, grain-threshers, animal attacks, crowds at stations… but a single image appears again and again, dominating the rush of images until the film is only a single static shot.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The repeating image is a view through a grimy window-pane of a nearby tower. There is a vague impression of flickering light around the tower-top. Just as the film ends, smoke plumes from the tower. That's it. Nothing of note at all… unless one happens to recognise the view of the Crucible Tower from the window of the Librarian's Quarters, and unless one happens to know that Ilse Bischoff never visited Brancrug, or even Britain, before her untimely death.
