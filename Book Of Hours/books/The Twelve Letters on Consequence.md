# The Twelve Letters on Consequence

## Description
The Twelve Letters On Consequence

Julian Coseley's epistolary treatise on 'what may come after', addressed to his once-friend Claude Hersault, the mystic and antiquarian.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

By the time he wrote these letters, Coseley was identified with the oneiropolitical 'Worms' movement, and Hersault with the 'Birds' - meaning roughly that Hersault held the order of the Hours to be desirable, and Coseley held it to be oppressive.
### Study Complete Description

Many of Coseley's arguments about consequence and finality are couched in erudite and practical alchemical terms. Others appear to be thinly-veiled threats directed at Hersault. Some are both.
