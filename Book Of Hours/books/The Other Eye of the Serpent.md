# The Other Eye of the Serpent

## Description
The Other Eye of the Serpent

In which the heresiarch Cygnifer attempts to resolve certain mysteries of Lightning.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Cygnifer considers Lightning to be 'the division, the connection, the joined serpent. The Serpent's Eye is said to be the Sun - but as the division and connection, it must have a second Eye.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Cygnifer considers and rejects, three times, the hypothesis that the Moon is the Serpent's other eye, insisting that it and the Sun do not share a nature. (This, as much as the Serpent business, is what got him burnt by the Church.) He proposes that the Serpent's teeth are towers, that the Serpent's mouth is a gate, that the Serpent is the 'devourer of Ys'... and 'therefore' that the Serpent's other eye is amber.
