# Kitling Ripe's Tasty Treats

## Description
[[Kitling Ripe]]'s Tasty Treats

[[The Velvet]] is the Hour of secrets; and so very little is known of the - Moth-long? Nectar-long? - who ascend to immortality under her auspices. But this book (by 'Kitling's Friend') purports to be part cook-book, and part manual for immortality.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Kitling Ripe is the name usually given to the speechless 'but never silent' cat-thing that serves as a Name of the Velvet. Kitling Ripe, it seems, enjoys hunting immortals; and the Velvet is very fond of Kitling Ripe..
### Study Complete Description

The secret, it appears, is to arouse the Kitling's appetite enough to become her quarry, but not <i>quite</i> enough to be caught. The Velvet permits the game, since it culls immortals careless enough to attract attention, and keeps her Name happy. The author bemoans the loss of the Carapace Cross' savour-secrets, which apparently were particularly tempting - but suggests decent spice-substitutes, which also happen to make for excellent pigeon-pie.
