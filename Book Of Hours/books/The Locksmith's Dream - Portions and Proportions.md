# The Locksmith's Dream - Portions and Proportions

## Description
The Locksmith's Dream: Portions and Proportions

The second volume of Teresa Galmier's examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans. The frontispiece has been slashed with a razor.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

In this volume, Galmier records fewer dreams, and explicates more of her own elaborate theories. 'We see this again and again: what is below can't escape what is above.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'The finest artisans all dream of [[The White Door]] in the end. I'm no artisan, only a scholar. I think there's a Secret that all these artisans know, but I think that Secret is only half the story.'
