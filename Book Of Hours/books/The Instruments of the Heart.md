# The Instruments of the Heart

## Description
The Instruments of the Heart

Sister Isabel, then Precentress of the Abbey-Church of [[St Brandan's]], engages in dialogues with a Heart-long of a kind called 'duendrazon' that has taken partial possession of her body.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The duendrazon, like all its kind, usually dwells in [[World/The Mansus|the Mansus]] but can enter the physical world by manifesting as music, and take possession of a willing - or semi-willing - mortal who hears and loves that musicâ€¦ like Isabella.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Isabella records her dreams of the high Mansus, where she is accorded the duendrazon's status and titles. In return, the duendrazon enjoys what it calls 'caesura' - a welcome oblivion. 'Our mostly-blessing is that we may never cease - except <i>in caesurae</i>'. There is something more that Isabella refers to as the 'caesura magna', but she laments that her duendrazon will not tell her exactly what that might be.
