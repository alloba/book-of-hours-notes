# The Chandler's Wish

## Description
The Chandler's Wish

Formulae and instructions invoking Moth, Lantern and - exceptionally, paradoxically - the liminal and theoretical Hour called [[the Chandler]]. The author is anonymous, admitting only that they are 'one who is not yet nameless.'
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The author makes a passionate argument that the Hour named Chandler is in fact the oldest, even though he does not exist, because he is - supposedly - the culminating event of a plan that precedes even Grail and Moth.
### Study Complete Description

'Where the Chandler has passed, the understandings of the Colonel and the Lionsmith will wrench open truth. Where the Chandler will pass, Moth will pass before him.'
