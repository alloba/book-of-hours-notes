# An Exorcist's Field Manual

## Description
An Exorcist's Field Manual

A practical guide to 'troublesome Dead', grounded in theory but with a clear focus on their disposal, by the redoubtable Detective-Ostiary Wheelock of the Suppression Bureau.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

'The Dead usually avoid Light - as the most immediate manifestation of [[Eternity]], which has no place for death. However those Dead 'uplifted by gold', that is to say touched by an actinic theoplasma, happily bod about in daylight and are perhaps strongest at noon...'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

''If you are dead but 'uplifted by green', that's the [[Ring-Yew]]'s blessing. (The Crowned Growth offers a similar but nastier benefit.) This is how Burgeoning Risen come about, but there are different degrees of sentience and freedom depending on which growths are involved. The consciousness of one 'uplifted by green' is always greatly altered, though - they never really seem like the same person. They may have dregs of their original souls, but these are often replaced by something else. The upshot, invariably, is that they need to be set firmly on fire.'
