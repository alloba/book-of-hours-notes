# The Iron Book

## Description
The Iron Book

A manual of the [[Ordo Limiae]], an order of quasi-immortals who maintained a secret enclave at the source of the river Limia, in the Roman province of Hispania Gallaecia. This manual was compiled by one Melerai Yivni, who claims to have travelled to join the Ordo from 'the Crossroads of the Waters'.
### Partial Study Description

Members of the Ordo took an oath, the Iron Chain, that required them to remain hidden from the world. This manual includes presumably long-obsolete addresses and pass-phrases that could have been used to find the Ordo's contact in the town of Iria.
### Study Complete Description

The final part of the manual describes the punishments for Ordo members who break their oath of secrecy. This includes an invocation used to summon the spirit called [[King Crucible]] as an agent of vengeance. Yivni cautions that this must be a last resort when the oathbreaker would otherwise go unpunished: summoning King Crucible might draw the personal attention of the [[The Forge of Days|Forge of Days]]. (A marginal note suggests, in any case, that [[King Crucible]], 'in a most transcendent Sulk of Sulks', no longer leaves [[World/The Mansus|the Mansus]].)
