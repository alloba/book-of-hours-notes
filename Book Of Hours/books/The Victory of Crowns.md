# The Victory of Crowns

## Description
The Victory of Crowns

Erratic accounts by 'Arun' of the hunting and consumption of supposed immortals by shadowy assassins. Published in the late nineteenth century.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The assassins are, according to 'Arun', the agents of a power called the Coronel, a 'soldier of the Secret Masters'. The accounts date back to Roman times.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Arun's scholarship is dubious, but he (she?) writes pithily. Incidents of sudden and violent death are interspersed with aphorisms: 'Hours don't dream. Long try not to.'
