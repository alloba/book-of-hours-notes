# Each Flame His Fuel

## Description
Each Flame His Fuel

A work by Omar, the Blaze, an initiate or craftsmaster at the [[Labyrinth of Lions]].
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Omar describes his work in the construction of mirrors for the enclosure of a sacred flame, and his slow realisation of 'a Flaw in the Glass'.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Omar explains how his lightsmithing techniques can be used, in the presence of sufficient Lantern, to enrich Xanthotic Essence into 'the Great Ink of the First History'. But he pleads caution in its useâ€¦ 'lest the Chandler be Realised.'
