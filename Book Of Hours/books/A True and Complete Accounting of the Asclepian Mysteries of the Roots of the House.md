# A True and Complete Accounting of the Asclepian Mysteries of the Roots of the House

## Description
A True and Complete Accounting of the Asclepian Mysteries of the Roots of the House

Descriptions of the 'Asclepian Mysteries', reproduced by one 'Rylee Grese' from - supposedly - a much older text. It's unlikely to be genuine, but it makes a reference to 'The House without Walls and its Wood' right there in the prologue.
### Partial Study Description

This is very obviously not an antique text. At the very least, it has been badly mutilated. But it contains substantial intriguing material: especially, a persuasive comparison of the [[World/The Mansus|The House Without Walls]], without doors to the human body, with its many portals.

'The direction of Death is down,' the book explains. '[[The Peacock Door]] has been considered a rent, or an abrasion, but in some respects is more like a mouth - if not a more treasured point of entry.' Discussions of the Doors include a rite which may conjure creatures through those doors, although key incantations are missing.
