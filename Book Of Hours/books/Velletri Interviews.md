# Velletri Interviews

## Description
Velletri Interviews

Interrogation of a man named Lacombe, a former Nocturnal Branch inspector now identified as 'terminally robigoid'.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Lacombe is not especially lucid, and the state called 'robigoia' evidently includes a malady of the lungs which causes coughing fits: he weakens audibly over the course of the interrogation. He is questioned about the disposition of various unsanctioned items recovered from a Nocturnal Branch raid on a castle at Ortucchio, in the region of the Fucine Marshes. He is, however, defiant as well as incoherent.

Lacombe insists the items have been put to good use; he derides Nocturnal Branch as 'the lackeys of Calyptra'. Alarmingly, during the last few minutes of the interrogation, he begins to insist that his interrogator should 'burn the Library'. He waxes enthusiastic about the fire he wants to see, leading to a final coughing fit after which the interview abruptly ends.
