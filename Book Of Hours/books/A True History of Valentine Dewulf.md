# A True History of Valentine Dewulf

## Description
A True History of Valentine Dewulf

Written in the third person by [[Valentine Dewulf|Valentine Dewulf]]. Rarely coherent, though it includes some useful footnotes on falconry and on exotic veterinary medicine.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Valentine is obssessed with the meaning of the Dewulf coat-of-arms: 'On a field or, a chevron enarched gules between two corby heads erased sable in chief and a wolf sejant sable in base.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'Long have the two birds pursued my blood, yet one is no Crow, yet it is darker. Long has the Wolf rolled itself in gold like a clovered cow, until its slobberings stain our thoughtsâ€¦'

## Speculation

(is the last line a reference to [[The Wolf Divided]] and [[The Beachcomber]] ?)
