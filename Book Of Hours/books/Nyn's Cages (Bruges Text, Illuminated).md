# Nyn's Cages (Bruges Text, Illuminated)

## Description
Nyn's Cages (Bruges Text, Illuminated)

The 'merciful measures of the witch Nyn. This is only a partial version of the original, but it contains illustrations by Nyn's pupil, Mabelie of Bruges, which supplement the original.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Nyn's stated aim was to 'keep beyond the Walls of Sleep that business which should not trouble the world'. This includes fever, madness and delirium as well as spirits identified as 'Devourers' and 'Deceivers'. (Mabelie clearly enjoyed drawing both Devourers and Deceivers, but was less interested in illustrating disease symptoms.)
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Nyn warns against invoking the Edicts Liminal or Inviolable before sleep - 'for no matter how secure a lock may be, its key will surely open it.' Mabelie has helpfully illustrated this by drawing a sleepwalker clambering through an open window, about to leap into the jaws of a sea-monster. The sea-monster is goggle-eyed with happy anticipation.
