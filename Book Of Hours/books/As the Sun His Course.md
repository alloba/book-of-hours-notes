# As the Sun His Course

## Description
As The Sun His Course

Joel of the Bridge, a retired soldier and sometime tollkeeper, wrote this epic poem about Alexander's famously inexplicable decision at Issus to withdraw from the war with the Achaemenids, and his subsequent return to Macedonia.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Alexander meets at Issus with Darius, King of Kings, for three days and three nights. On the first day, the two men trade threats; on the second, promises; on the third, secrets. Darius tells Alexander something so shattering that he retires to his tent to consider 'matters of strength and matters of mastery'.

I've Read...

At dawn on the fourth day, Alexander announces: '[[The Sun-In-Splendour|the Sun]] has his course, upon which he returns; and so do I'. He returns to Macedonia, executing two of his captains when they dispute his decision. He brings with him the 'names of a blind God', and a 'rite of sacred betrayal': for, Joel opines, without betrayal there would be an end to war.
