# Bee-Silk Journal

## Description
Bee-Silk Journal

'Picasso? I'll give you Picasso.' [The Artist came to Hush House to shape and share a History of primal, ultimate, unprecedented experience; but you can complete the game by recording any History. You might wish to begin your studies with the Bosk Wisdom.]
### Partial Study Description

### Study Complete Description
Grail: Birth!

I've mastered this, and gathered the lessons it concealed.
## Info
- A version of [[A Drowned Book]].
- Can be given to the Postmistress to receive [[A Letter to the Librarian]] and a [[Ten Shilling Note]]

## Determination
Applying 20 of an aspect to the journal applies a determination. 

### Red, The First Flower
Make a Determination: Red, the First Flower

[[The Watchman's Tree]] is the covenant that forbids knowledge to mortals, but permits it in the covenant-houses of the Tree... like Brancrug Isle.The Red Flower of Calyptra -'the fire fuelled by truth' was its first defence. Fire consumes knowledge... but fire also gives light. The Tree is rooted in paradox. [Adds Forge and Rose to your journal; replaces any other First Flower Determination. Adding Determinations to your Journal makes it first possible, then easier, to write a matching History.]
