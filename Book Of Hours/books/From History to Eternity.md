# From History to Eternity

## Description
From History to Eternity

A contraband manual of the Inks of Revelation. The author explains in a brief foreword that she is a high-ranking officer of 'an agency of the Duties' and that, though she supports its mission, she has concerns about the long-term consequences of its work.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

'All Histories braided into a golden loop; a shining ascent to Eternity. I had never imagined I could be afraid that there might be too few Truths. I could be wrong. But I'd like to leave at least one door ajar.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'Ichor Auroral' can be brewed into an <i>encaustum terminale</i> associated with the Second History, using Inks of Revelation techniques with Rose aspect. The author warns that this is exceptionally difficult, since these techniques aren't aligned with Rose. 'But that's why I'm hoping the door will stay ajar, even once all the others are closed. I wish you luck.'
