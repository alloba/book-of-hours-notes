# The Intimations of the Skin

## Description
The Intimations of Skin

Fiendishly complex, weirdly distorted illustrations of 'congress and anatomy' by the haunted visionary painter Niels Frederik Malskær.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Malskær illuminates the evolutions of the Names of the Grail with unfortunate clarity. It seems that a Lovely who consumes an Ivory becomes an Ivory. A Lovely who consumes a Thirstly becomes a Thirstly. A Lovely who consumes a Name of another Hour might take its place...
### Study Complete Description

In the penultimate illustration, a Lovely grapples with a fungoid knot that can only be a Name of the Crowned Growth. The Lovely's mouth and other portals gape wide, and the Growth-Name is already partially engulfed - but it seems that Malskær couldn't bring himself to illustrate the result, and the final illustration is only a scrawled, bloated obscurity.
