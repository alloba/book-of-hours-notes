# Towards a Fundamental Aesthetic - Second Edition

## Description
Towards a Fundamental Aesthetic: Second Edition

Or, 'The Refinements of Light'. [[Book Of Hours/people/Julian Coseley]] had never wanted or expected to write a second edition of his masterwork... [This book houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Julian Coseley long regarded [[Solomon Husher]] as a charlatan. But his friend [[Nina Lagasse]] painted three paintings before her death in 1895â€¦ and these paintings apparently convinced Coseley to change his mind. With considerable irritation, he revised his magnum opus. 
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The perfect hegemony of the Hours is, perhaps, eternal. Coseley had always championed History rather than Eternity - the exceptions, limitations, contradictions of freedom. But Husher's and Lagasse's work convinced him to believe in the 'paradox of the eternal ending', a means in which perfection might be reconciled with freedom. He's not happy about it. This is perhaps the angriest book ever written in support of a peaceful philosophy of acceptance. But Coseley was always scrupulous about his conclusions.
