# The Grand Passage of the Hours

## Description
The Grand Passage of the Hours

The Limian Burzghash's gazetteer of the patterns and rhythms of the Hours' progress through [[World/The Mansus|the Mansus]], from Concursum to Malleary, Malleary to Woodâ€¦
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

'Each century in the Mansus is a great feasting-hall. In each ninety-ninth year, the hall falls silent; the [[Elegiast]] sits alone at the feast.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...
