# The Rose of Hypatia

## Description
The Rose of Hypatia

A volume of collected teachings of the [[Sisterhood of the Triple Knot]], that arcane-contemplative order that existed in all histories, but in some was very powerful indeed. This was recorded by 'Hypatia', and dedicated to St Nympha.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

St Nympha is described as 'not born, but cultivated'. The sentience that became the saint, 'Hypatia' indicates, inhabited a sinner's corpse in order to enable that sinner's redemption.
