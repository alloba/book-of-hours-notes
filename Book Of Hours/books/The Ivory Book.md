# The Ivory Book

## Description
The Ivory Book

A manual of the Ordo Limiae, an order of quasi-immortals who maintained a secret enclave at the source of the river Limia, in the Roman province of Hispania Gallaecia. This manual was compiled by one Kurenai, who claims to have fled 'the tyranny of the Chrysanthemum Throne' to cross the world and join the Ordo.

Members of the Ordo took an oath, the Ivory Chain, not to have commerce with the Hours. Followed literally, this would be almost impossible for an adept, so the manual contains numerous clarifications, exceptions and processes of indulgence.

Kurenai describes the Order's burial rites, which include spells to ensure - in theory - that the souls of dead Long are not given to the Hours. The Hour called the Ivory Dove, who memorialises and commemorates, is to be invoked, in secret, in these rites, 'for with that Hour we have made an understanding'.
