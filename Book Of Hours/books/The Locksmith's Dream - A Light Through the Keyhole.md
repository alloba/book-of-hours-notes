# The Locksmith's Dream - A Light Through the Keyhole

## Description
The Locksmith's Dream: a Light through the Keyhole

The first volume of [[Teresa Galmier]]'s examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The parallels in mystic dreams experienced by carpenters, masons and other artisans, and what they purport to reveal about the architecture of the world. Surprisingly mordant and even funny. No-one has ever explained why Galmier devoted herself to this quixotic exploration of artisan's dreams.
### Study Complete Description

I've Read...

'Time and again we hear of the Wood, which rises from the world's foundation. All trees reach for light. What does the Wood reach for? Is there a difference between light and Light? I think the key to dreams of the Wood might be one of these - the one that isn't exactly real.'
