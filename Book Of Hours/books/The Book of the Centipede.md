# The Book of the Centipede

## Description
The Book of the Centipede

In the mid 1860s one 'Madam Yi' presented an entertainment based, she claimed, on this book.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

'The Centipede always found her way into the dark places. When she was punished for it, she reacted badly, in [[World/The Mansus|the Mansus]] as in Miah.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'The River runs through the sands out of myth and into legend. The Painted River runs the other way. One is barred to the Centipede now, but she finds ways back in, sometimes.'
