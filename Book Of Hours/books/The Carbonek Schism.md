# The Carbonek Schism

## Description
The Carbonek Schism

The order of Obliviates, on the brink of schism, assembles in a Bounds-house identified only as 'Carbonek', after the Fisher-King's castle of legend. There the Know and the Long of the order debate their long policy of non-involvement in 'matters of Feather and Scale'.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

One of their number - the one recording their debates - describes how in desperation he has found some kind of solution in a 'volume of transcendent heresy', but dares not pursue it alone. He convinces a handful of other Obliviates to depart Carbonek with him, while the others cross the sea to Port Noon.

I've Read...

In the last few pages, the author reveals himself as the Know-adept [[Ambrose Westcott]], writing in an uncharacteristically serious mode. He informs any who should find this work that he has returned the book he spoke of to '[[Abbot Geffrey]]'s Secret', where it can be retrieved with certain invocations of the Sacra Limiae. He hopes that one who has read this far, and understood this much, will find a History to determine.
