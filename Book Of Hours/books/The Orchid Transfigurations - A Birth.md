# The Orchid Transfigurations - A Birth

## Description
The Orchid Transfigurations: a Birth

The second volume of a compilation of quasi-Rosicrucian allegories, supposedly by Robert Fludd. This is in the original Latin.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Fludd, or pseudo-Fludd, suggests alignments between the alchemical tradition of rubedo and the older Grail traditions, through the Pine-Knight's quest for the Cinnabar Cup.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Seek the Cup in the birthing-bed,' the Pine-Knight is told. The Midwife at the birthing-bed, to his amazement, is the Mountain-Mother. In a fit of awe, he both gelds and flays himself. The Vigilant Storm bursts joyfully from the remains.
