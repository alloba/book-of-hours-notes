# The Five Letters on Memory

## Description
The Five Letters On Memory

Julian Coseley's epistolary treatise on 'matters memorial and mnemonic', addressed to his then-friend Claude Hersault, the mystic and antiquarian.
### Partial Study Description

The book is partly a practical manual, expounding memory-palace-like techniques, and partly an exploration of 'Memory Rarefied' - modes in which sense or experience persist outside a mortal mind.

This is an early work, and by Coseley's standards it brims with optimism, even enthusiasm. If books, he suggests, are the memory that does not die, then 'perhaps with sufficient Endeavours, Memory's Murderer might be Contain'd'.
