# A Drowned Book

## Description

> I Remember...

> There was a storm. It smashed the ship like an egg. But I seized this book as the sea seized me... then the sea brought me here to Brancrug. And Brancrug is where I wanted to be. But it's hard to remember why. What else did I lose in the storm?

A Drowned Book

The one possession I kept from the shipwreck. It must be important to me. [The Aspects below tell you more about how and where you can use this item. Mouse over them to learn more.]
