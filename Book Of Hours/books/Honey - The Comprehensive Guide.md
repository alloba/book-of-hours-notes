# Honey - The Comprehensive Guide

## Description
Honey: the Comprehensive Guide

[[Harvey Hattington]] - pilot, polymath, confectioner - writes with great enthusiasm about the 'marvellous work of the Bee'.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Hattington insists that all the primary aspects - Nectar, Scale, Heart, Lantern, Moth, Grail - are possessed by bees and expressed in honey. (Clearly, he points out, there are only six primary aspects, as a honeycomb has only six angles.)
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'Yewgall Ink is prepared with these techniques - but so is Skinshuck Mead, and only Skinshuck requires honey. Just as any beverage or foodstuff can be improved with the addition of honey, so any garden is improved with the presence of bees. Even those bloody Blomberende.'
