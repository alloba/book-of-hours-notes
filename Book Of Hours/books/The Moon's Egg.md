# The Moon's Egg

## Description
The Moon's Egg

The third and last volume of the meditations of Abbot Thomas of the Abbey of the Black Dove.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Abbot Thomas speaks of the coming death he hears in the sound of the waves, but rejoices that his blood will water the 'Egg of the Moon' - by which he seems to mean the future.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The last chapter was dictated, not written, by Abbot Thomas. When Thomas' old sword-brother Trygve returned to raid the Abbey, Thomas had broken his monastic oaths and taken up arms to defend the abbey. The two had both been mortally wounded. Thomas' last words are 'The Wheel turns; the Moon sleeps.'
