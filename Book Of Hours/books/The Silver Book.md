# The Silver Book

## Description
The Silver Book

A manual of the Ordo Limiae, an order of quasi-immortals who maintained a secret enclave at the source of the river Limia, in the Roman province of Hispania Gallaecia. This manual was compiled by one Burzghash, who explains that he came to join the Ordo from the 'city of messenger eagles' after he abandoned the service of the Ivory Dove.

Members of the Ordo took an oath, the Silver Chain, that forbade men to lie with woman, or women with men: 'for what may come is not always the Crime of the Sky, yet that is a furious danger.' It was apparently permissible for men to lie with men, and women with women - in fact, Burzghash suggests that should be encouraged, to distract from other temptations.

The manual prescribes potential countermeasures to protect those who might be tempted to go against the oath: masks, disfigurement, severe poetic disciplines. Those who do break it are to be punished with death, although there are lesser punishments prescribed for various acts that don't involve actual coitus. Death is to be administered with 'the Glassfinger Toxin', which can be created with the assistance of the techniques described earlier in the manual, and with sufficient Knock aspect.
