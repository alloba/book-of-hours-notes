# Journal of Thomas Dewulf

## Description
Journal of [[Thomas Dewulf]]

Thomas Dewulf, 2nd Baron Brancrug, was nicknamed 'Baron Silence of Castle Silence' for his taciturn severity - most likely the origin, eventually, of the name 'Hush House'.
### Partial Study Description

As he records the passing of the Great Comet in 1576, the tone finally becomes more animated but also more obscure. Thomas cites his Dawn Period namesake, Abbot Thomas, as an authority on 'Wind, Moon, and Shell in the Heavens Inferior'. He observes: 'My predecessor knew this Truth - three Blossoms hath the Watchman's Tree: Paper; Ink; and Flame. The Great Comet, I now aver, is that Flame.'
