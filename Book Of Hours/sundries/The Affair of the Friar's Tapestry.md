# The Affair of the Friar's Tapestry
## Description
The Affair of the Friar's Tapestry

A tapestry has been stolen from the Haustorium that depicts details of a very old rite indeed - one that may only be performed at Gladwyn Lake 'when the moon is ripe'. Exactly what it might renew is unclear, but almost inevitably someone will try it anyway. [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=moon> or <sprite name=nectar> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
