# An Old Friend's Address

This card changes depending on the type of librarian that you choose at the start of the game. Three options exist, depending on how things go. 

## Shapt Description
An Old Friend's Address

[[Mrs Kille]] is the handywoman - the midwife - of [[Brancrug Village]]. I knew her long ago in Paris, when her surname was not 'Kille' but 'Raveline', and her sister was a viscountess. Her home is always open to me (though she's asked me not to bring up the title thing when Mr Kille's around).  I can find shelter for tonight under their roof  - <b>once I've reached Brancrug Village</b>. 

## Lantern Description
An Old Friend's Address

I first heard of Brancrug through its Rector, Reverend Timothy. For years now I've been exchanging letters with him. I can find shelter for tonight under his roof - <b>once I've reached Brancrug Village</b>. [The Rector can also introduce you to other villagers.]
