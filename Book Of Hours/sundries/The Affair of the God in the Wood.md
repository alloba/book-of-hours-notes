# The Affair of the God in the Wood
## Description
The Affair of the God in the Wood

The 'Lyterion', a faddish health camp in the Black Forest, has attracted attention after many of its clients seem to have developed sudden, sometimes upsetting, artistic abilities. [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=heart> or <sprite name=nectar> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
