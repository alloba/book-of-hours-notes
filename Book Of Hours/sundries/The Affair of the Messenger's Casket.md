# The Affair of the Messenger's Casket
## Description
The Affair of the Messenger's Casket

In a hidden fold of the mountains above the city of Cluj lies the enigmatic relic they call Saint Mihael's Coffin. Decades of patient work have finally breached its outer shell. [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=knock> or <sprite name=moon> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
