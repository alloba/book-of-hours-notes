# Upper Pump Room

## Description
Upper Pump Room

See the pickaxe marks on the walls. Before the Sisterhood came to the Isle, the Romans or the Phoenicians dug these tunnels, scratching in the ground for tin and for gold. For centuries those pumps kept the sea at bay, driven by slaves or votaries who saw the sun one day in nine. When those pumps fell silent, the sea crept in - until, much later, the Curia brought in their own machines to open up the lower levels again.
