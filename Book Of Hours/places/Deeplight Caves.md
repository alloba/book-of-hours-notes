# Deeplight Caves

## Description
Deeplight Caves

When the gods-from-stone were swept away, the Carapace Cross who had served them were swept away too. The Seglaz-kind, the Wyrmefota-kind, the Glaeterfloge-kind, all those wise and mighty ones are gone, into [[Nowhere]] or hiding or us. Here in the fire-warmed waters, away from the justice of sunlight, their legacy quietly thrives.
