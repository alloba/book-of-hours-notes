# Hermit Cell

## Description
Hermit Cell

The words [[Red William]] are scratched into the wall by the bed-nook. This was the name of the cunning-man who laid a curse on [[World/Hendrik Dewulf|Hendrik Dewulf]], that there would be no seventh of his line - the cunning-man that Hendrik Dewulf gelded and imprisoned beneath the House.

But this doesn't look like a cell. There could have been no locks. Perhaps that other story is true - that William was an initiate of the [[Thunderskin]], secretly maintained by Hendrik to prophesy for him 'in the ancient manner.' Who were the Dewulfs, really?
