# Lesser Bridge

## Description
Lesser Bridge

Brancrug Gaol: built in 1896 at the behest of Nocturnal Branch, to contain 'troubles unseemly and occult'. A mere six years later, after the Ortucchio Incident, the Branch came itself to be considered 'unseemly and occult', and its functions were absorbed into the Suppression Bureau. But the Gaol still stands.

Over the gate is the Bureau's motto: ALLIS SI LICET, TIBI NON LICET, commonly rendered as IT IS PERMITTED TO US; IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO YOU.
