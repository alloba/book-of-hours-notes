# Kitchen Garden

## Description
Kitchen Garden

In 1652, [[World/Musgrave Dewulf|Musgrave Dewulf]] caught a travelling pedlar stealing vegetables from this garden - an eccentric wanderer who went by 'Ricardo Milagro'. Musgrave's ancestors would simply have hung the fellow, but Musgrave decreed seven years' service in the garden instead. When the seven years were up, Milagro had proved his worth as a gardener and chose to make Brancrug his home. The grapevines here were planted with rootstock he carried in his pack.
