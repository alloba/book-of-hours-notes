# Severn Chamber

## Description
Severn Chamber

In the days of the Dewulfs, this chamber was reserved for the heir of the House - though it was originally furnished for [[Hafren]], the woman of 'uncertain lineage' who became Baron Walter's mother and bequeathed her unusual pale eyes and hair to Walter and his descendants.
