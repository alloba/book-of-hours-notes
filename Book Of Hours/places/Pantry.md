# Pantry

## Description
Pantry

This room is close to the roots of the House; and so it had a troubled reputation with the servantry, who late at night might hear the pulse of an unseen drum, the buzzing of flies, voices crying out in tongues unknown... and so the servants would trade favours not to be the one to fetch spices for his Lordship's posset after dark.
