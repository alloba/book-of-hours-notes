# Description
## Initial
The Sweet Bones 

After the Restoration of 1930, [[King Henry IX|the New King]]'s agents came looking for his enemies in these parts... and they weren't gentle about it. Since those days, the locals are suspicious of foreigners. No-one in the Sweet Bones will talk to me.

### Introduced
The 'Sweet Bones'

The 'Sweet Bones' has been the public house in Brancrug since Cromwell's time. Its history is notable; its beer is not. Guests looking for discreet employment, or for discreet assistance, congregate in the snug.
