# Cell - Worm-Inhabited

## Description
Cell: Worm-Inhabited

The occupant of <i>this</i> cell could not be allowed fresh air and exercise. It could not have reasonably expected to leave this cell ever again, even while it wore human shape. But it could not be confined forever; in the end, somehow, it found its way into the walls.
