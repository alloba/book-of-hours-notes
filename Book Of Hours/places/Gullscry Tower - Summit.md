# Gullscry Tower - Summit

## Description
Gullscry Tower: Summit

In 1721, Valentine fell - or leapt - from the tower top. There were no witnesses, and his body was not found for three days. His daughter Eva was the last to see him alive, and of their last conversation, she would say only that he had begun to fear the sun.
