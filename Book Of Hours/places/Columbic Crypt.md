# Columbic Crypt

## Description
Columbic Crypt

<i>St Columba, with twelve companions, brought the word of the Unconquered Sun to Scotland, where he founded a monastery on the blessed isle of Iona. There he died and there his bones remained until the Northmen came.</i>

<i>But in Cornwall they speak of his thirteenth companion, a 'hybrid beauty' called [[Rowena Hengerst|Rowena]] who was perhaps his tutor, perhaps his seducer, or perhaps his daughter. At his death, the monks sought to stone her for her impurities. She bore Columba's bones away so the monks would not have them - substituting, out of tact or mischief, the bones of a horse. She brought the bones to a hidden Isle, where she made a double foundation of nuns and monks, and become its first abbess: but she would admit none to her order who was a virgin, nor innocent of any crime. Since then, the Isle has been a refuge for all the world might consider impure.</i>
