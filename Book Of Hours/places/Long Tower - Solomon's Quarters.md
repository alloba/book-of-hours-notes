# Long Tower - Solomon's Quarters

## Description
Long Tower: Solomon's Quarters

Generally reckoned the chilliest room in the House. The Long Tower was usually called the Winter Tower until Julian Coseley - magus, epistler, reputed Long - dwelt here briefly in the seventeenth century. [[Solomon Husher]] was the second known to sleep in the room. Evidently they didn't mind the cold.
