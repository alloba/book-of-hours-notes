# Librarians's Quarters

## Description
Librarian's Quarters

When the Curia of the Isle acquired the deed to the abandoned Dewulf estate, [[Ambrose Westcott]] became first Librarian, and had this cosy nook constructed above the north wing to fit his preferences. His successor Kitty preferred the room next door (she lamented that the reek of Westcott's pipe remained long after his death) and her successor, [[Solomon Husher]], preferred the Long Tower for his own chilly reasons. But most Librarians have enjoyed the peace and the sea view.
