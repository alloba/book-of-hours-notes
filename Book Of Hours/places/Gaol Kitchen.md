# Gaol Kitchen

## Description
Gaol Kitchen

'There are no Hours at Brancrug,' Collers used to say - even before he was Governor of Brancrug Gaol, when he was only Secretary Vigilant of the Curia. By way of reminder, the hands were confiscated from every timepiece within the prison walls. The warders could still rely on the chimes of the great Clock in the abbey spire. But it did make life harder for the cooks.
