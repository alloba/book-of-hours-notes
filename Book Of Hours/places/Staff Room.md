# Staff Room

## Description
Staff-Room

The warders at Brancrug were a cut above your usual prison warder - former Bureau constables, repentant Know, turncoat Tragulari, veterans of the LÃ©gion du Seuil. When the end came, none of that mattered. But here, for a while, when the winter storms battered the walls, they hunkered close to this glowing stove to share tea and comradeship and stories of their very different lives.
