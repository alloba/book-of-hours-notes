## Description
Servants' Quarters - North

This was once the private chamber of the formidable [[Ernestine Peterhans]], Seneschale of Brancrug. Baron Hendrik, and afterwards his son Thomas, would both descend the back stairs to visit her in person. For counsel, most said; for prayers, others insisted. Only the very foolish ever suggested there was any improper motive for their visits.
