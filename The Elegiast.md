an [[Hours|Hour]]

The Elegiast, also called The Ivory Dove, is one of the [[Hours]], associated with hour IX, or 9:00am. His Aspect is Winter. 

The Elegiast memorializes and commemorates the Hours cast into [[Nowhere]]; in [[The World Does Not Weep]], it is said that "the world forgets, but the Ivory Dove does not". In ancient times, the Long of the Ordo Limiae maintained a pact with The Elegiast to ensure that their souls would not fall into the hands of the Hours in the event of their deaths.
