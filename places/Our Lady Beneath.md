# Our Lady Beneath

## Description
Our Lady Beneath

Who is 'Our Lady'? The Red Grail, which gives life, which takes life, which is not sated? The Horned-Axe, who bears two blades, who waits and the threshold, who sunders that which should not be joined? The Ring-Yew, who is succulent, who is renewed, who encompasseth? Or a fourth, who is always signified but never named?

A Librarian might phrase the question differently: who was first?
