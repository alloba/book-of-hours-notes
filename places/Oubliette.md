# Oubliette

## Description
Oubliette

Here in a vessel shaped by fire and fate, George Collers confined a flame in human flesh, a blazing shadow of a blazing future, a Name of greed and time. Greene called it '[[Sun-In-Splendour|the Sun]]'s bastard grandchild.' Van Lauren warned of 'the Second Dawn's first spark'. But Collers spoke of it reverently: as 'the Leashed Flame's true heir'.
