# Night Gallery

## Description
Night Gallery

In the 1850s, and in deep secrecy, Natalie Brulleau built the Night Gallery into the foundations of the Gullscry Tower. Behind this heavy steel door the Curia, and later the Suppression Bureau, kept  treasures too difficult for common view, but too relevant to consign to a deeper vault. If anything difficult might, hypothetically, have been inclined to creep up the stairs from below, it would also have been discouraged by that door.
