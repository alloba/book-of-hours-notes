# Gullscry Tower - Valentine's Room

## Description
Gullscry Tower: Valentine's Room

In his youth, Baron Valentine inclined to religion, and he made pilgrimages to holy sites on the Continent. After he made his final pilgrimage - to Fermier Abbey - the dreams began - of blood seeping from the earth; of a vast and pulsing Wheel crushing the temples of men; and, which troubled him most, of twisted birds, shrieking in pain, growing like fruit in the branches of an ancient yew.
