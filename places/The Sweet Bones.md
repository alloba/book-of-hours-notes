# Description
## Initial
The Sweet Bones 

After the Restoration of 1930, the New King's agents came looking for his enemies in these parts... and they weren't gentle about it. Since those days, the locals are suspicious of foreigners. No-one in the Sweet Bones will talk to me.

### Introduced
The 'Sweet Bones'

The 'Sweet Bones' has been the public house in Brancrug since Cromwell's time. Its history is notable; its beer is not. Guests looking for discreet employment, or for discreet assistance, congregate in the snug.
