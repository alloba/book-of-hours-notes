# Gullscry Loggia

## Description
Gullscry Loggia

When Baron Valentine's melancholia and his acusis became too much to bear, he began to take his meals here, with none of those sounds that he found troubling - only the wind, the sea, and the cries of his beloved birds. After the Dewulfs were gone, the Librarians of the Curia would come here when they needed to think in peace.
