# Chapel Calicite

## Description
Chapel Calicite

The Red Grail says: Never speak of this Mystery. I was always the first, and I must always be greatest. When we spilt the blood of the Thunderskin, I feasted and I grew strong, stronger again than the Twins. There is always a feast, and nothing is truly wasted.
