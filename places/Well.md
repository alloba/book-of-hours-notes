# Well

## Description
Well

There's been a well here since the days of the Sisterhood, and superstitions have gathered around it like leaves in drifts. Its water has a healing virtue if drawn on a night of the new moon. It's ill luck to draw from it if you hear an owl. If you drip the blood of a living enemy into the well, they'll drown. And so on. Certainly, when Numa comes, the mists are lie thick here.
