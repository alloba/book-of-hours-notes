# Sacred Spring

## Description
Sacred Spring

The Eye marked on the rocks here is not the Watchman's Eye that decorates the church above, but the Eye that marks the Temple of the Wheel in dreams. The priests of the Sun would tell you there was no sight before the rising of the Sun; but those who've drunk from this spring will dream of another sun, one that swung lower in the sky, one that would speak with us, one that would accept friendly gifts of blood from us.
