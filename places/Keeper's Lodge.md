# Description
Keeper's Lodge

For five hundred years - in the times we call Baronial, Curia, Nocturnal - there was always a keeper to watch the ways, weed the gardens, mend the roof when the sun was shining. There is no keeper now, but the Lodge's roof still weathers the storms of Brancrug Bay.

The first section of [[Hush House]] that can be said to be accessible - even if it isn't really a fully part of it.
