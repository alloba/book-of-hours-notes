# Cell - Long
Cell: Long

The few Long at Brancrug were kept in cells triple-buttressed with silver and steel and sanctioned spells. The Bureau knew their weaknesses, but never relied upon them. This cell last housed <i>two</i> immortals - an Edge-long dyad. This would have required not only ferocious and eternal vigilance, but also frequent replacement of shattered furniture.
