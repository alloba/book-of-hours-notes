# Gullscry Tower - Eales' Room

## Description
Gullscry Tower: Eales' Room

[[Eales Dewulf]] inherited his father Valentine's madness, and was found unfit to inherit, so his sister Eva held the Isle in his stead. When his fits of violence became uncontrollable, he was confined here in the tower, where his sister would visit him three times a week - until his escape, some time in the late 1720s. Eales's ultimate fate remains unknown.
