# Violet Chamber

## Description
Violet Chamber

In the days of the Dewulfs, this chamber was reserved for the lady of the House. Later, the Librarians Willem Harries and [[Gervinus Van Lauren]] both preferred it to the Librarian's Quarters. Harries  established a little shrine to St Agnes in the far corner, and there it remained for many years until van Lauren ordered it to be removed.
