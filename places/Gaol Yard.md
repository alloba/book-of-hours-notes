# Gaol Yard

## Description
Gaol Yard

The gaol was nicknamed the 'Cucurbit', for the alchemist's flask that distils and refines. Prisoners would become better versions of themselves, realigned to responsibility. Hence, though it would have been much safer to confine the more potent inmates to their sealed cells, Governor Collers insisted that even they should be allowed fresh air and exercise.
