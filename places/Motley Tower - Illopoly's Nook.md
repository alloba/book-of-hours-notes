# Motley Tower - Illopoly's Nook

## Description
Motley Tower: Illopoly's Nook

Christopher Illopoly - poet, painter, archivist, ruiner of seances - stayed on for a while at Hush House after the Great War. The Librarian, Serena Blackwood, arranged rooms for Illopoly in the Motley Tower, ostensibly so he could help with the collection, but perhaps also because she saw a potential ally against the Governor of the Cucurbit... relations between the Cucurbit and the House were badly strained at the time.
