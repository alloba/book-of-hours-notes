# Hidden Stair
Hidden Stair

After Brulleau's retirement in 1861, the Curia found itself short of promising candidates - until he arrival of Willem Harries, a former Dutch Lutheran priest and a sometime correspondent of Stanislav Schaller. He had been a missionary in the Dutch East Indies until his faith was lost or transmuted into a devotion to St Agnes of the Gate, and he was drawn to Hush House.

He won his position by presenting the Curia with a 'key long lost'. That was the key to this very stair, but only the naive would assume the key was a tangible object.
