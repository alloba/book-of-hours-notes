# Description
Watchman's Tower: Gatehouse

Back in the eleventh century, Brian of Brittany built the Tower and its gate to protect St Brandan's Abbey - as Hush House was then known. Later, the Barons Dewulf strengthened the gate against their many enemies. But it's a long time now since Hush House was any kind of fortress... and by the time the scholars of the Curia took possession, this place had long been a comfortable waiting room for visitors to the House too minor to merit immediate attention.
