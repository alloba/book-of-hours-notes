# Physic Garden

## Description
Physic Garden

The nuns of the Knot planted this garden of healing herbs in the Dawn Period. Natan of Regensburg and Gideon Dewulf both expanded it, and the Curia of the Isle tended it. Even the Branch and the Bureau made use of it in the grim days that Brancrug served as a prison.
