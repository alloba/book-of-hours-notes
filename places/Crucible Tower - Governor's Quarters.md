# Crucible Tower - Governor's Quarters

## Description
Crucible Tower: Governor's Quarters

In this room, the Governor was Collers the artist, Collers the dreamer. It was a side of him that almost no-one saw, especially when, after the death of his wife, he grew so much more solitary. That said, there is a connection to be drawn between his enthusiasm for sculpture, and his ambitions for his human subjects.
