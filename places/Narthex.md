# Narthex

## Description
Narthex

If you were a pilgrim to the Abbey of the White Crow, you'd purify yourself here. You didn't want to track profane Dumnonian mud or alien Mare Britannicum salt into the holy precincts. Or unclean thoughts. Especially not unclean thoughts. The priestesses here were a little more merciful than the Hours they served, but only a little.
