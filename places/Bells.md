# Bells

## Description
Bells

Giver, Teller, Shur's Tongue, Lady Janice and Great Paycock are the names of these bells, though they're older than the Abbey itself and those names have certainly been corrupted over the years. By 1915, Shur's Tongue and Lady Janice were too cracked to ring, and the Suppression Bureau paid for them to be recast - Serena Blackwood's <i>quid pro quo</i> for the assistance she gave George Collers with his clock project.
