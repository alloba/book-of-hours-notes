# Spire

## Description
Spire

Here Hendrik Dewulf met in secret with King Henry - once the Bronze King, now 'Old Coppernose', for the Great Debasement had ended the supremacy of the Leashed Flame, and Henry's heirs were no more than human. There is a story that Hendrik's son Thomas listened from the rafters - that three times he heard Henry ask his father to break a certain promise in the matter of Caer [[Ys]] beyond the wave, and the third time, the father did not refuse the king. This, says the story, is why Thomas never liked to make a promise thereafter, for fear of breaking it.
