# Refectory

## Description
Refectory

Here, the whole Curia used to meet - the Librarian, and the  Secretaries Salvant, Vigilant and Enigmatic. Sometimes even the Secretary Nunciant, though the duties of that office usually kept him away from the House. But there has only ever been one Secretary Persistent, and she has never liked to eat in company.

That was in the good times of the Curia's heyday. In later years, the Governor of the Gaol would sit at one end, the Librarian at the other, and the clock would tick away the long silences between their words.
