# Tower Clock

## Description
Tower Clock

George Collers, governor of Brancrug Gaol, oversaw the design and installation of this great clock, with the reluctant help of the Librarian Serena Blackwood. She might have refused ouright, had she known how he intended to reuse the horologist's techniques for his so-called 'condignator'.

An inscription on the greatest wheel reads 'STRIKE THE HOURS'.
