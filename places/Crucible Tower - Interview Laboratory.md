# Crucible Tower - Interview Laboratory

## Description
Crucible Tower: Interview Laboratory

When a prisoner resisted all other interventions, Collers would bring them here, to test and refine their worth. His successes might be transferred to Zurich, or turned over to the LÃ©gion du Seuil to earn their humanity, or even, at least once, released. But his successes were not numerous.

Here, at last, is where the fire began and where it ended. When the power below the prison was released, it came here to interview Collers. Perhaps it intended to put him in his own device; but it seems there was not nearly enough left of him for that.
