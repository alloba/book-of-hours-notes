# Infirmary

## Description
Infirmary

In the fifteenth century, Natan of Regensburg came to Brancrug. The brothers of St Brandans granted sanctuary, but they would not permit a Jew - and his family! - to live on abbey grounds. Still they built this tower for him to dwell in and practice his healing arts. It has changed greatly since that time, but a place of healing it remains.
