# Aspect of the Malachite - Mylissa, Queen and Palace

## Description
Aspect of the Malachite: Mylissa, Queen and Palace

One of the kinder aspects of the Malachite: Mylissa, both Queen and Palace, who feeds all comers, whose body is the house in which her children dwell. Mylissa was not always a Name of the Malachite. She may have been a Name of another Hour - she may even have begun among the Carapace Cross, before she chose Eternity over History.
