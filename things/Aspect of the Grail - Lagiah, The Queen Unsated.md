# Aspect of the Grail - Lagiah, The Queen Unsated

## Description
Aspect of the Grail: Lagiah, the Queen Unsated

One of the crueller aspects of the Red Grail: Lagiah, the Queen Unsated, devouring mother, sister-lover of Antaios. One tradition has it that Lagiah took animal form so that she could satisfy her craving to devour her own children, and go unpunished - another that the animal form was the punishment for her incest. The Grail has often been tolerant of contradictions. Perhaps her part in the Intercalate really was, after all, a long and subtle move to undermine Eternity. Or perhaps she's just not to be trusted.
