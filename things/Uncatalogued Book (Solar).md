# Uncatalogued Book (Solar)

## Description
Uncatalogued Book (Solar)

[Catalogue this to learn more]

Catalogue a Solar Period book

This book was probably written around the time of Hush House's Solar Gothic Period - roughly, between the 1000s and the 1500s. If I examine it, I can learn more about what knowledge it might contain. [Books from this period are occasionally contaminated.]
