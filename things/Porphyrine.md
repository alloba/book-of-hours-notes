# Porphyrine

## Description
Porphyrine

The <i>encaustum terminale</i> of the Second History. It's the glowing crimson-mauve of the Secret Histories. Porphyrine was venerated in secret by a confraternity of corresponding Cluniacs and Benedictines. [Use an Encaustum ink with your Journal to make Determinations and record Histories. If the Hours listen, the world changes.]
