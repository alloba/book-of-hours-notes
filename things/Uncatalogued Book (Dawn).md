## Description
Uncatalogued Book (Dawn)

[Catalogue this to learn more]

Catalogue a Dawn Period book

This book was probably written around the time of Hush House's Dawn Period - some time before the end of the first millennium, commonly reckoned. If I examine it, I can learn more about what knowledge it might contain. [Books from this period are sometimes contaminated.]
