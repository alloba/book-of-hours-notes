# Julian Coseley

## Description
'Julian Coseley'

Julian is known to be Winter-long: at a prescribed date, his Hour-patron will ensure him a beautiful ending, but until then, he is even harder than most Long to dispose of finally. That said, he is known to have been defeated by an ascendant Long in the 1920s, and his true current status - a diminished survivor? a determined memory? something else? - is the subject of esoteric debate.
