# Aspect of the Axe - Xenocide Half-Faced

## Description
Aspect of the Axe: Xenodice Half-Faced

One of the more enigmatic aspects of the Horned-Axe: Xenodice Half-Faced, who welcomes or slays strangers at the threshold. Xenodice is sister sometimes to owl and cat, sometimes to bull and butterfly, sometimes to dove and serpent. This hybrid nature suggests a link with the prehuman Carapace Cross - but that's not so surprising in a Name of the Axe.
