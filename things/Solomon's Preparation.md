# Solomon's Preparation

## Description
Solomon's Preparation

Solomon Husher would take this every night without fail before sleep, to close his ears to the sound of the waves. But on the 9th of January 1838, a heavy snow fell on Hush House. When the other residents dug themselves out, Husher was nowhere to be found. He had left a resignation letter, and an undrunk measure of his Preparation.
