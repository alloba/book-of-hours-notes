# Uzult

## Description
The ink in which the First History was recorded by the Unwise Mortal. Uzult is the bright yellow-gold of Lantern. Light lingers on it for a little while even in the dark. Gold is not needed to mix Uzult, but amber is. Unobtrusive shrines to Uzult could sometimes be found in the churches of the Unconquered Sun.
