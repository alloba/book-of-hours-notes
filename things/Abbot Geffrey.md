# Abbot Geffrey

## Description
'Abbot Geffrey'

It was Abbot Geffrey who gave [[Natan of Regensburg]] sanctuary here, and decreed the building of the Barber's Tower where Natan and his family could dwell. In fifteenth-century England, only a determined and well-respected abbot could have persuaded the brothers to shelter a Jewish physician.
