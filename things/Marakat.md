# Marakat

## Description
Marakat

The <i>encaustum terminale</i> of the Fifth History. The colour of the Principle that once occupied the place that Heart does now. In the Fifth History itself, the cult of Marakat was everywhere suppressed, but it's sometimes been venerated otherwise. [Use an Encaustum ink with your Journal to make Determinations and record Histories. If the Hours listen, the world changes.]
