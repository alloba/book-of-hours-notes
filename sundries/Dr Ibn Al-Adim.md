## Description
Dr Ibn al-Adim

'The Aleppine': Historian, doctor, and above all, traveller. The good doctor has been associated with all but one of the libraries of the Watchman's Tree. He was even Secretary Nunciant of Hush House for a little while, but he has never been on good terms with the Suppression Bureau.
