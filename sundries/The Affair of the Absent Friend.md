# The Affair of the Absent Friend
## Description
The Affair of the Absent Friend

The Ligeian Medusa is long dead, as is well attested. It's nevertheless well-attested also that she walks the streets of Budapest by moonlight. That's just one of those things. But now, for the first time, she's being glimpsed in daylight too. What could <i>that</i> portend? [Visitors with an interest in edge or rose Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
