# An Old Friend's Address
## Description
An Old Friend's Address

[[Mrs Kille]] is the handywoman - the midwife - of [[Brancrug Village]]. I knew her long ago in Paris, when her surname was not 'Kille' but 'Raveline', and her sister was a viscountess. Her home is always open to me (though she's asked me not to bring up the title thing when Mr Kille's around).  I can find shelter for tonight under their roof  - <b>once I've reached Brancrug Village</b>.
