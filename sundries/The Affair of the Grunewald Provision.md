# The Affair of the Grunewald Provision
## Description
The Affair of the Grunewald Provision

After the dissolution of Grunewald's Permanent Circus, its assets were disposed of by the Bureau. That was during one of the Bureau's occasional funding crises, and the 'Grunewald Provision' sanctioned the sale of the Circus' assets for cash, bypassing some of the usual checks for oneiric hazard. In hindsight, this has started to look like a mistake. [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=heart> or <sprite name=winter> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
