# A Matter of the Midnight Twin
## Description
A Matter of the Midnight Twin

In Numa, visitors will be concerned with matters of shadow and substance, revelation and obscurity. [As long as this card remains, Numatic visitors will have an interest in <sprite name=moon> Mysteries. Their needs will usually be more exacting than visitors who come during more traditional seasons.]
