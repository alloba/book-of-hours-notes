# The Affair of the Open Reverend
## Description
The Affair of the Open Reverend

In a highly specialised clinic in an obscure corner of the capital, specialists study the ecstatic agonies of the case known only as'the Open Reverend', who once was the vicar of the parish of St Agnes Forestreet. The blessings of St Agnes of the Fires and St Agnes of the Shears are ungentle. But St Agnes of the Threshold may be her cruellest aspect...  [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=heart> or <sprite name=winter> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
