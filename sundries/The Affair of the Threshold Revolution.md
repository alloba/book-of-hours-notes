# The Affair of the Threshold Revolution
## Description
The Affair of the Threshold Revolution

In the drier reaches of the Bounds, the Légion du Seuil keeps a brutal peace. Perhaps even a necessary one. But the Légion recruits from among the Bounds-beasts. How trustworthy is it, really?  [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=edge> or <sprite name=grail> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
