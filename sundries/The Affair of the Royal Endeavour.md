The Affair of the Royal Endeavour

The New King has sanctioned the use of the Crown's wealth to fund a visionary new industrial project - one that will transform our economy, and furnish the kingdom with a sense of patriotic mission. Parliament, dazzled, has already passed the Royal Endeavour Act, mandating the construction of the necessary facilities, although the details remain in some respects vague. [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=forge> or <sprite name=lantern> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
