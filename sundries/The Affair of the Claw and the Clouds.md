# The Affair of the Claw and the Clouds
## Description
The Affair of the Claw and the Clouds

From the far monastery of St Tentreto in the Evening Isles, we hear uncertain and contradictory stories, of unexpected visitors - visitors from behind the sky.  [Visitors with an interest in <sprite name=scale> or <sprite name=sky> Mysteries will want to talk about this.]
