# A Letter to the Librarian
## Description
A Letter to the Librarian

A letter to me from St Rhonwen's Trust. The Trust's connection with Hush House is probably benevolent, but persistently obscure.
## Sources
- [[Post Office]]
## Info
### Reading
> The Letter Reads...
St Rhonwen's Trust wishes to congratulate me on my appointment as Librarian of Hush House. The Trust assures me that it will provide the promised stipend each spring... but reminds me that its resources are limited, and suggests I seek local assistance in restoring the premises. 'Let us know when you're all set up and ready to receive visitors,' the letter concludes. It's signed simply 'the Trustees'.

'The journey was difficult, but nothing could keep me from the House, and the place is everything I had imagined! - or will be, once I've restored it to its old glory...'
