# Fugitive's Assistance
## Description
Fugitive's Assistance

'Hold your noise!‚Äù called a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch. [...] A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied around his head.' - Dickens
