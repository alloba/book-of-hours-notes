1st Baron Brancrug. Granted Brancrug Isle in 1536, after the dissolution of [[St Brandan's]]


Dewulf had been a mercenary captain on the Continent, under the notorious [[Maarten van Rossum]]. He was a hard man in a hard time, but not a simple one. He left van Rossum's service after the sack of the Hague, apparently after a spiritual crisis;  it is known that he was at one point in training as a priest.
