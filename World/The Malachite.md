An [[Hours|Hour]]

The Malachite, also called The Ring-Yew, is one of the Hours, associated with hour III, or 3:00am. Her Aspects are Grail, Heart, and Moth. She is a God-from-Flesh, and it is said that she has forbidden, secret liaisons with [[The Mare-in-the-Tree]] in [[The Wood]] of the Mansus. The Malachite's sphere is desire, restlessness, and whimsy.

The Ring-Yew once loved [[The Thunderskin]], who was destroyed by [[The Red Grail|The Grail]] as part of a peace treaty with [[The Horned Axe]] for the killing of the Gods-from-Stone.
