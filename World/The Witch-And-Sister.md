**Note - The origin and information here is shared with [[The Sister-And-Witch]]**

The Witch-and-Sister, also called The Twins, is one of the Hours, associated with hour VI, or 6:00am. She is the inverse of [[The Sister-And-Witch]]. Her Aspects are Grail, Moth and Heart, in that order. 

The Twins are Gods-from-Flesh with a common origin. According to [[The Larquebine Codex]], they "came from the West, where they were born in two wombs, one a princess, one a monster. Nevertheless they loved each other from birth, and met in secret 'to seek union'." 

The kings of their land attempted to sacrifice the princess and witch to end a drought, but they escaped across the sea before eventually despairing and drowning themselves. Thus, they entered the [[World/The Mansus|Mansus]] through [[The Painted River]] and the offices of [[The Red Grail]], and became an Hour. Later, as explained by the mystic Brodnax in [[Those Who Do Not Sleep]], The Red Grail grew jealous of The Twins' growing power and created [[The Thunderskin]] to counter them.
