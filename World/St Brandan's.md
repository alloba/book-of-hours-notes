A monastic order that lived on the Isle during the [[Solar Gothic Period]]. 

Known operation spans something like (600 - 1534], although the start date is a guess. (will update when further dates are found.)

Initially formed by a brother and sister ([[Rowena Hengerst]]) who came to the island during the [[Dawn Period]], and who conversed with the [[Sister-and-Witch]], seeking to merge their beings. That particular task did not work out overly well (see [[Book Of Hours/places/Rowenarium|Rowenarium]]), but the siblings went on to form the double foundation of monks and nuns which would become St Brandan's. 

> _...close but separate, and they made a double foundation of monks and nuns, as chaste as they had always been, but each nun had her brother-twin and none could enter alone._

Initially the presence of both men and women would be said to be a centrally defining feature of the order, although that changed after the death of [[Abbess Nonna]] in 1349, which was said to dissolve the double foundation. After this, only men were permitted to join for the rest of the order's existence.

It's eventual dissolution was recommended by [[John Tregonwell]] sometime shortly after the 1530s, who was appalled by what he learned of the order in its later days. The order was dissolved in 1534 by [[King Henry VIII]]. 

(Although I'm not sure if the recommendation was the primary motivation, or was rather a final nail in the coffin. )

# Notable Events

St Brandan's spans quite a bit of time (seemingly), and has direct ties to [[Hush House]] as it stands today. So there's a decent enough list of things. 

- The Siblings come to the island and speak to the [[Sister-and-Witch]] in dreams, and form the order
- Expansion of the Abbey via funding from [[Eva de Braose]] (?1230 - 1349)
- Construction of [[Long Tower - Solomon's Quarters|the Winter Tower]], dedicated to the [[Madrugad]]. (?1230 - 1349)
- Death of Abbess Nonna (1349)
- Order is dissolved by [[King Henry VIII]] and property (the Isle) handed to the Dewulf family ([[World/Hendrik Dewulf|Hendrik Dewulf]]) - 1534
