A monastic order that lived on the Isle during the [[Solar Gothic Period]]. Quite influential in terms of the history of the place. 

It's dissolution was recommended by [[John Tregonwell]] - appalled by what he learned of the order in its later days - although I'm not sure if that was the ultimate cause, or was rather a supporting argument.
