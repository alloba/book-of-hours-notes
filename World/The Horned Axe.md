an [[Hours|Hour]]

The Horned-Axe is one of the Hours, associated with hour XIII, or 1:00pm. Her Aspects are Knock and Winter. 

She is the last surviving God-from-Stone, those Hours who came into being before humanity, as all the others perished in [[The Lithomachy]]. The Horned-Axe "watches all thresholds", and in particular stands with [[The Velvet]] in vigilant opposition to the all-consuming encroachment of The Crowned Growth. She is enemies with [[The Witch-And-Sister|The Twins]], as it is their nature to unify while hers is to divide.
