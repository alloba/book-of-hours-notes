The Mansus, or the House of the Sun, is a place or concept where the Hours dwell in the illumination of [[The Glory]]. Mortals can access the Mansus in spirit and traverse its five different Ways by Dreaming. 

Mortals have classified the Mansus into three loosely-defined regions. The Wood is the lowest and darkest region, and the first place living mortals arrive at as it contains the first Way they pass through on their dreams. Above The Wood, but only just so, is The Bounds, which contains the second Way, [[The White Door]], an aperture that denies speech to all who cross it, living or dead. Above The Bounds loom the pseudo-stone halls and passages of the Mansus proper, with access to its higher levels barred by three more Ways: The [[The Stag Door|Stag Door]], The [[Serpent Gate|Spider Door]], and The [[The Peacock Door|Peacock Door]]. Beyond those lies one final barrier, The Tricuspid Gate, which leads to the summit of the Mansus. There, where [[The Glory]]'s Light shines brightest, the Hours parley, and the greatest secrets of the world are curated, one can achieve enlightenment or immortality.

The Book of Dissolution describes an earlier incarnation of the Mansus with a different structure and doors. The [[The Forge of Days|Forge of Days]] reshaped the Mansus and opened the current Ways. According to The Concursum Diaries, the Mansus changes each year, but the Ways remain constant.

# Locations within the Mansus
- **The White Door**
> Many of the Dead enter the Mansus through the White Door. They wander its corridors in silence until the yare lost .Some embrace each other, some devour each other, some force their way into the dream of the living. A few record their memories on the Mansus-stone where it is soft. They scratch it with their nails, you see. Last night I read one of those memories.  
 
 > Last night the White door was bright as a mirror, bright as fresh snow, bright as the migraine moon. I remember its brightness, but I remember its chill the most. I laid my cheek against it. I still feel the ache of its cold in my skull.

- **[[The Wood]]**
  > I walked in the Wood last night, and the scissors worked in the distance and the furred things crammed my mouth and swarmed my ears, and I felt the old urge to drop to wolf-fours and nose among the roots. but I remembered that I walk upright by day and I know fire and steel and words, and at last I found where the Velvet had concealed a secret on tree-bark beneath moss. I read it then with the tips of my fingers, and I think now that I could write it in full.
- **The Well**
  > The Well in the Wood is never dry, but it is never clear. One night it might heave with crawling roots; on another it will pulse with bright moss. On night of the full moon its waters are choked with the fat dappled bodies of moths. Last night, I saw it brimming with dark and viscous blood. Gelatinous shreds drifted on its surface; clots of Grail-matter
