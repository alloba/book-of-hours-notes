Rowena is supposed to have been the thirteenth companion of St Columba. Perhaps a tutor, or seducer, or daughter, to him. 

She took his bones after his death to prevent the monks of his order from having them, and bore them to a hidden Isle. Here she formed [[St Brandan's]], and became its first abbess.

If you bother to take the bones of someone like that and also your entire order is defined by how you ran away with your brother to an island, it's easy to think that somehow the two things are linked together. But It seems like the brother was quite alive, and came to the island with Rowena to found the order. And St Columba is clearly very dead by the time they get there. So I'm not sure.
