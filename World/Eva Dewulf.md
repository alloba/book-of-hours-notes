Baroness Eva - satirist, salonni√®re, herpetologist, and last of the Dewulfs.
7th Baroness Brancrug.

Daughter of [[Valentine Dewulf|Valentine Dewulf]].

Eva Dewulf had a lot going on. 

Almost married [[Abraham Wheelock]] in London, but after he left her at the altar, returned to Brancrug. Had a romantic relationship with [[Franklin Bancroft]] which only probably didn't result in a secret heir to the line. Prolific writer. 

She died by suicide via drowning, along with her two grandchildren (whom she brought along for the ride). This marked the end of the line of Dewulf.
