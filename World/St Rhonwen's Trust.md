A Trust with some affiliation with [[Hush House]]. The Trust reaches out to the main character of the game with a job offer, to become [[The Librarian]] of [[Hush House]]. Although how they came to know of the Librarian-to-be in the first place is not shared. 

The trust's affiliation to the House is stated to be 'probably benevolent, but unclear'. This seems to be true, since other than the [[A Letter to the Librarian|single communication]] that is received initially (along with a followup if necessary), the Librarian has no further contact with the trust, other than to receive a relatively generous yearly stipend. 

The Trust is also responsible for sending visitors your way every season. I'm unsure if they literally control the flow of all people to the House, but they certainly at least reserve the right to recommend someone go there. 

Currently the only known named individual to have worked with the trust is [[Book Of Hours/people/Dr Serena Blackwood|Dr Serena Blackwood]], a previous Librarian (although it can be assumed at least several others of the same position have had interactions).
