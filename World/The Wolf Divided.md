an [[Hours|Hour]].

The Wolf Divided is one of the Hours, associated with hour XVI, or 4:00pm. His Aspects are Edge and Winter. 

The Wolf Divided is said to be the wound of the division of [[The Sun-In-Splendour]], but he is counted among the Gods-from-Blood, not the Gods-from-Light. The Wolf's nature is violently nihilistic, an insatiable appetite for destruction combined with an everlasting hatred of existence. He is associated with a sharp smell that is neither blood nor ozone.
