An [[Hours|Hour]]

The Vagabond, also called The Centipede, The Laughingthrush, The Sight-Thief, The Proverbial Footloose, The Pilgrim, and many other names, is one of the Hours, associated with hour XVII, or 5:00pm. Her Aspects are Moth and possibly Secret Histories. The Vagabond is a God-from-Flesh, and the only Hour who does not dwell in the [[World/The Mansus|Mansus]]. 

According to [[The Book of Masks]], The Vagabond was born in a place called Miah, where she was punished for entering its temple-precinct. Sometime after ascending to Hour-hood, she took her revenge on Miah as The Centipede by cursing it "to drink only dust and to be remembered only by the wind". As The Laughingthrush, she was a friend of [[The Sun-In-Splendour]] before his division. As The Sight-Thief, she created [[The Painted River]] in the Mansus. As The Vagabond, she has been barred from the Mansus for some incident that has yet to occur.
