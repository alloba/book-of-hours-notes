# The Leashed Flame

A combined term for a captive power that was granted by [[The Forge of Days|The Forge]], as well as the group of individuals controlling it. The power was enough to raise the group or leader of the group beyond normal humanity. 

The Sovereigns of the Leashed Flame was an order created by the royalty of England at the start of or during [[The War of the Roads]], in the mid-to-late 15th century. The war itself being facilitated by power afforded England after an alliance was brokered with The Forge. 

The order went on to rule for a time. Supposedly the alliance with the Forge took its toll on the group however, and had soured sufficiently during [[King Henry VIII]]'s reign for him to attempt to cheat the Forge. This did not go according to plan however, and [[The Great Debasement]] released the Leashed Flame, and brought the king back down to humanity, bringing an end to much of the sovereigns' authority.
