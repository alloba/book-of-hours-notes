The Watchman's Tree is the covenant that forbids knowledge to mortals, but permits it in the covenant-houses of the Tree... like Brancrug Isle.


>Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortalsâ€¦ except in nine great libraries protected by the covenant-stones they hold, where this knowledge can be safely recorded in the inks called <i>encaustum terminale</i>. These libraries are together called the Watchman's Tree, and the covenant marked by these stones shares that name. All this, then, is a matter of Preservation.
