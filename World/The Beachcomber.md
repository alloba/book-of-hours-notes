an [[Hours|Hour]]

The Beachcomber, also called The Beach-Crow and known to some as Cryppys, is one of the Hours, associated with hour X, or 10:00am. His Aspects are Grail and Knock. The Beachcomber is a God-from-Flesh, and it is suggested that he is a thief, a spy, and a voyeur. As Birdsong states, "He has hidden the memory of secret couplings among the Hours and their Names in the corners of the House, as treasures to gloat over."
