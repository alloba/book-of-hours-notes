An Hour, now deceased. 

> 'You know, Librarian, that the Hour named Seven Coils was a god-from-stone. She fell to the blades of the [[The Colonel|Colonel]]… but one tradition is that she 'drowned in her own blood'. And another tradition has it that her blood is golden… as the Sun is golden. I can almost make sense of it, but only almost... I do not think that I will visit this oracle. I am afraid of what I might learn.'
