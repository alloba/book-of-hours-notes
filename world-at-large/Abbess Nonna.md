The last abbess of [[St Brandan's]]. 
Officially, murdered in 1349 by 'perversions of the healing arts'.

There is an account made by one of the sisters accused of her murder that states that it was not at all intentional. See [[The Most Sorrowful End of the Lady Nonna]]. 

According to this account, Nonna was a member of an unsanctioned [[Thunderskin]]-cult, and invited the two accused sisters to join in a meeting. During a rite, something went awry and the entire group murders Nonna, but then accuse the two sisters and have them serve as scapegoats. 

After Nonna's death, the monastery never again accepted female novices.
