A Trust with some affiliation with [[Hush House]]. The trust reaches out to contact [[The Librarian]] when they first arrive at Brancrug, although how they knew the Librarian would wash ashore is a mystery. 

The trust's affiliation is stated to be probably benevolent, but unclear. This seems to be true, since other than the [[A Letter to the Librarian|single communication]] that is received initially (along with a followup if necessary), the Librarian has no further contact with the trust, other than to receive a relatively generous yearly stipend. 

The letter received from the trust even seems to imply that they make your presence known to the wider world, and are partly responsible for guests arriving to the library.  


Currently the only known individual to have worked with the trust is [[people/Dr Serena Blackwood|Dr Serena Blackwood]].
