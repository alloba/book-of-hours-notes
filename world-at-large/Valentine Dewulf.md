Valentine Dewulf, 6th Baron Brancrug, known for his eccentricities.

In 1721, poor Valentine fell from the top of the [[Gullscry Tower - Summit]]. Perhaps it was his melancholia that killed him - there were no witnesses, and his body was not found for three days. His son, [[Eales Dewulf]], was in no fit shape to inherit; and so his daughter [[world-at-large/Eva Dewulf|Eva]] became Baroness at the age of only nineteen.
