daughter of [[world-at-large/Valentine Dewulf|Valentine Dewulf]].
Last of the Dewulf line.

Eva Dewulf had a lot going on. 

Almost married [[Abraham Wheelock]] in London, but after he left her at the altar, returned to Brancrug. Had a romantic relationship with [[Franklin Bancroft]] which only probably didn't result in a secret heir to the line. Prolific writer. 

She died by drowning, along with her two grandchildren. This marked the end of the line of Dewulf.
