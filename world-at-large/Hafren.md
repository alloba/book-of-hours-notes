Mother of [[world-at-large/Walter Dewulf|Walter Dewulf]], wife of [[Giles Dewulf]]. 

Her marriage to Giles was a big scandal, with her being a person of no notable heritage. It caused a rift in the family that was only barely healed before the passing of relevant parties. 

Noted for having a pale complexion, with potentially an associated health issue. It's unclear what the ultimate effect is, but it is enough to have [[world-at-large/Eva Dewulf|Eva Dewulf]] be concerned about it. The only description I have been able to locate is that it caused her 'unusual pale eyes and hair'.
