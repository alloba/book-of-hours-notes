Rowena is supposed to have been the thirteenth companion of St Columba. Perhaps a tutor, or seducer, or daughter, to him. 

She took his bones after his death to prevent the monks of his order from having them, and bore them to a hidden Isle. Here she formed [[St Brandan's]] (i think), and became its first abbess.
