# Numa

## Description

Numa

Numa, shortest season, labyrinth season, when the year loses its way, when Time is a river and Memory a winged bird. In Numa, oddities ripen in the gardens of the Isle - unexpected visitors arrive - memory departs. [When Numa ends, all Memories will vanish with it - even persistent ones.]

### Mystery Aspect

...?

This is something or someone from Numa - the time when 'seems' and 'is' cross swords with 'history' and 'eternity'.
