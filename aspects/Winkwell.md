# Winkwell

## Description
Winkwell

Sometimes when I turn this book to the right angle, I see an eye peering at me from its pages or covers. They close and fade when I leave them in the dark... but light will always bring them out eventually. [This can affect your Fet and Wist, and spread to nearby objects. You can remove it with a skill that's effective against Corruption, and at least 7 Moon.]
