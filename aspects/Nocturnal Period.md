# Nocturnal Period

## Description
Nocturnal Period

By the beginning of the 20th century, an unwise Librarian's enthusiasms had brought Hush House to penury. Nocturnal Branch - later the Suppression Bureau - stepped in to offer an arrangement. Hush House received funding, but submitted to yearly inspections, and also surrendered a portion of the Isle for the Branch's prison.
