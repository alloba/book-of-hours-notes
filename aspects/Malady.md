# Malady

## Description
Malady

Something has snared or sickened my soul. [Soul cards can be Malady-tainted when you're exposed to dangerous influences - sometimes when you fail in a task. Maladies cannot be exhausted, but your soul is altered and weakened, and there can be serious consequences if they go untreated.]
