# Numen

## Description
Numen

Write a truth in a book that no-one reads. Then drop dead. No-one knows what you wrote. Unless the truth is <i>numen</i>. [Numina are truths so powerful that they, tentatively, believe themselves. You can use a Numen to write a new History at a suitable Desk... if you can assemble 25 of a matching Aspect.]
