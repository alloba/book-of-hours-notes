# Numen - The Sun's Weakness

## Description
Numen: the Sun's Weakness

The Sun's sins and the Sun's scars are our salvation. There are Histories where they will trap us - prevent us rising to Eternity - [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Executioner can use it to win a particular victory.]
