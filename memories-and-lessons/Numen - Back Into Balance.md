# Numen - Back Into Balance

## Description
Numen: Back Into Balance

When the travelling Carapace-kinds passed beyond the wave and the sky, they made arrangements for their return. There are Histories where those arrangements might be invoked...  [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Executioner and the Revolutionary can win a particular victory.]
