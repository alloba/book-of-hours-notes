# Numen - Three Rules

## Description
Numen: Three Rules

The Hours are bound by their own edicts - even the Chancel and the Calyptra. That's why their deepest rules are secret. In certain Histories, if we know those deepest rules, we know what even the Chancel and the Calyptra may not do.  [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Revolutionary can win a particular victory.]
