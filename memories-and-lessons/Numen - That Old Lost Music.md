# Numen - That Old Lost Music

## Description
Numen: That Old Lost Music

In the right Histories, every song ever sung still lingers in wind and echo, untouched by the demands of Eternityâ€¦  [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Symurgist and the Magnate can win a particular victory.]
