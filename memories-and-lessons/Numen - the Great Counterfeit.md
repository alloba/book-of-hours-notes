# Numen - the Great Counterfeit

## Description
Numen: the Great Counterfeit

The [[Sun-In-Splendour]] and the Forge of the Days could not be joined. But Sunset Celia and the Swan King could. This secret is the trick of it. [Any Librarian can use this to establish a History and complete the game - but the Twice-Born can win a particular victory.]
