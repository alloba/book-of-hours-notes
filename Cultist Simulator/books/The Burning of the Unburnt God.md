# The Burning of the Unburnt God

## Description

> Compiled by Hosty Tasmane from oral traditions in rural Persia. 

## Aspects
## Source
[[Morland's Shop]]
## Study
> Tasmane hypothesizes a pre-Zoroastrian fire deity, whose rites were the rites of smiths.

> Tasmane ultimately concludes, with apparent reluctance, that the deity was a goddess. He suggests that its gender may have been the cause of its suppression. The rites described are often eerie, sometimes grisly. 
## Reward
- [[An Ardent Orison]]
- - [[Rite of the Crucible Soul]]
