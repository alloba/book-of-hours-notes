# Graveyard Mouth

## Description

> Now that I have tasted the graveyard fruit, the hunger comes often to trouble me. My mouth waters at the fragrances of decay, and my belly growls like a dog. 
> (Reduce this by feeding on Remnants. Do not ever permit it to reach seven, the game may end, and not pleasantly.)
