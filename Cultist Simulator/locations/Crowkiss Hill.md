## Description
> The ancient tribes reserved this resting place for one who, by the end, in service to a certain merciless Hour, was more scar than man. They sealed the entrance with binding-songs and mortared blood. 

> Others have been here before us - power still lingers, and no doubt they use it in their ceremonies. They have taken some of the warrior-king's funeral treasures, but left something of their own.
