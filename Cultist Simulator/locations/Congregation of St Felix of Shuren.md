# Congregation of St Felix of Shuren

## Description
> A Nonconformist enclave of a heterodox sect of a Calcinist offshoot, tucket away in an odd corner of the city. They belt out hymns with unsuitable gusto, in a throat-scraping language that is very much not quite Latin

## Exploring
> Membership of the Congregation is strictly controlled. It may even be inherited. The safest approach is to burgle the minister's residence while he's conducting a service - but the sworn mothers of the Congregation guard the place in shifts, and they are not easily distracted

## Rewards
