# Rite of the Watchman's Sorrow

## Description

> This rite recalls the loss of the Watchman, who walks the house which has ne walls. (Light goes before him and shadow behind. He must not see you.) The instrument of power is used to summon him to take his sacrifice: precious knowledge from the root of your thoughts. The assistant must speak the words that anchor your sanity, so choose someone you trust.
