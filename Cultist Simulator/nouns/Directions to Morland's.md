## Uses
### Study
#### Find Morland's Shop

> The directions to Morland's shop are cryptic. When one deals in the kind of books my correspondent studied, one must be circumspect.

> An ill-lit street at an ill-favored bend in a lesser river. A soft yellow light through a grimy window. Miss Morland nods as I enter, but doesn't rise. 'I never ask the names of my clients.' she informs be, before I have time to introduce myself.
