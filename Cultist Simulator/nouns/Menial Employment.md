## Uses

### [[Work]]
#### Another Shift at the Hospital

> Another shift: mopping the darkened hallways, delivering post to hollow-eyed invalids, trundling corpse-laden gurneys to the basement.

> Halfway through your shift, the head porter beckons you aside. 'We won't require your services any longer' he says. 'Here: your last payment. We've paid you through the end of the month.' I have lost my job. At least now I have a little time to rest, and my Health improves. (Dream is unlocked.)
