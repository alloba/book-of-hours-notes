# Three Flowers Hath the Tree

## Description
Three Flowers Hath the Tree

Ernestine Peterhans records her observations of the growths of trees and flowers around the Isle, and the omens and portents she attempts to draw from them - particlularly the yew-tree in Earl Brian's Meadow, whose flowerings are sometimes eccentric.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Ernestine observes that in years when the tree flowers black, 'troubling Secrets arise'; when it flowers red, war and fires follow; and that no Dewulf heir has ever been born in a year when it flowers white...
### Study Complete Description

Ernestine attempts to use the tree's growths to advantage in her business affairs, but it fails. She is evidently very concerned when Hendrik Dewulf's son Giles runs off with 'the Pale Trollop Hafren' in a year when the tree flowers white - she begins to fear she has entirely misinterpreted all the relevant omens. She is deeply concerned for the continuation of the Dewulf line, and prays for Giles' return.
