# Advice on Containment

## Description
Advice on Containment

Thirza Blake discusses ways 'to keep Wood-things out of trouble, and Mansus-things in it.'

Thirza notes the similarities between the Lantern-long habit of 'scrining' - returning to the physical world, despite their absence of a body, by entering a mirror or light - and [[Poemander]]'s techniques of confining Mansus-long to mirrors. She wonders whether Poemander himself might be lured to visit Hush House if provided with a sufficiently alluring scrine.
