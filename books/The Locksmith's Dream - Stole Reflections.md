# The Locksmith's Dream - Stole Reflections

## Description
The Locksmith's Dream: Stolen Reflections

The fourth volume of Teresa Galmier's expansive work - no longer a discussion of the dreams of artisans, but a valuable survey of other works. The tone is calmer than that of 'Trespasses', but occasionally fearful, even paranoid. This volume was published in 1926 but almost immediately recalled and pulped by the publisher - at the request of the author or possibly the authorities, depending which story you believe. A few copies survive.
