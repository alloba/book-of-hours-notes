# The Sun Disfigured

## Description
The Sun Disfigured

A scroll of anthropoderm parchment, written in the golden ink called Uzult. [This book houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
### Partial Study Description

The author of the text calls herself 'the Elagabaline'. Sometimes she seems to be Sunset Celia, the Watchman's Name; sometimes she seems to be Lady Tryphon, the Grail-long. It is unclear whether these are separate entities or the same person - it may be unclear even to the writer. 
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The flaws in the Sun's Plan are elucidated. The Sun's Plan itself is never entirely clear, but it is a project of some kind to enter, possess, or surrender to the Glory - the pure light above the Mansus. This book suggests ways in which that Plan might fail.
