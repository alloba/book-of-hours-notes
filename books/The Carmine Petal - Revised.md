# The Carmine Petal - Revised

## Description
The Carmine Petal: Revised

An apparently theoretical project proposed by 'Lionel' of the Society of the Noble Endeavour which might permit the imprisonment of a renegade Forge-Name. A very heavily revised edition of an earlier and even more controversial work.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The book was evidently revised some time after the Wars of the Roads had ended, but even then this kind of discussion would have been politically difficult.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'Lionel' suggests that the Disciplines of Scar and Hammer together would be necessary to create such a prison - but that either on its own would serve to release its occupant.
