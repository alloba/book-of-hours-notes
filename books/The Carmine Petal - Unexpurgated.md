# The Carmine Petal - Unexpurgated

## Description
The Carmine Petal: Unexpurgated

A project proposed by 'Lionel' of the Society of the Noble Endeavour by which, he claims, he succeeded in creating a sanctuary for a fugitive Forge-Name. The unexpurgated version.
### Partial Study Description

At the time this book was written, a 'fugitive' Forge-Name would have been guilty of heresy, treason, or both.

'Lionel' suggests that the 'house of iron and fire' so created would include 'hollows of air and night', which would serve as a final hiding-place if the larger sanctuary were uncovered - though, he says, they could be easily revealed with invocations of the Disciplines either of Scar or of Hammer.
