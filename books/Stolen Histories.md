# Stolen Histories

## Description
Stolen Histories

The agitator and pamphleteer Alexander Sparrow inveighs against the 'monstrous Serpents, Thieves of History.'
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Sparrow acknowledges five Histories, insists the Third History may be 'overrun by Coils', warns the Fifth History is already lost.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Sparrow, with his usual paranoia, appears to be conflating the horror of the Worm Wars and the Great Writhing with the activities of the Great Hooded Princes. Still, he draws thought-provoking comparisons between the Princes - normally conceived as exotic Knock-long - and the widely feared Worms.
