# The Concursum Diaries

## Description
The Concursum Diaries

The diaries of the explorer and murderer Lars Westergren. He's unhelpfully translated them into Phrygian, for privacy.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

There are map-legends, there are maps of legends, and there are legends of maps. Aspects of [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]] subsist in all of these, in much the same way that you find water in a swamp and in a cup and in the sky.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Westergren describes a series of expeditions into the Mansus. He focuses on the details of the experience - the colours, the vistas, the textures - rather than the practicalities. He does warn that the Mansus changes each year, although he assures the reader that the Doors have been the same. 'Doors may close, but they never disappear. At least not while there have been mortals in the Mansus. We're like mice.'
