# The Gospel of Zacchaeus

## Description
The Gospel of Zacchaeus

An extremely heterodox account of the Nazarene Messiah and his works, describing his ascension to [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]] through the opening of his body.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Seven were the wounds of His body, seven the doors of the House. Seven the lesser aspects of the Hours, and Knock the aspect above all, for the [[Mother of Ants]] is the Mother of Salvation.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The book includes a description of a rite which can be used to raise a corpse to half-life, 'in memory of He who bled for the Wood'; but the marginalia claim that the Mother of Ants no longer permits use of this rite.
