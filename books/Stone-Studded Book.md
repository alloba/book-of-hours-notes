# Stone-Studded Book

## Description
Stone-Studded Book
Dull-gleaming yellowish stones. Amber? I feel that I should know...

>A Journal?
>My journal - I'm sure of it. The storm scattered my thoughts, but each page I turn is familiar. I begin to recall now why I came here... and the two lives I've lived.  [More about your origin, and your aspirations, in your journal.']


Turns into the [[Amber-Flecked Journal]]
