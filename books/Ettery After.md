# Ettery After

## Description
Ettery After

An anonymous erotic novel occasionally claimed to have been written by Eva Dewulf, although at least two duels were fought in her honour to avenge this slander.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The novel graphically details Madame Ettery's various imprisonments, ravishments and escapes in the debauched Commonwealth of Tinctures and its neighbour, the pious Atrament.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

It becomes apparent that many of Ettery's lovers and pursuers - Catwink, Houndsgall, Nilique - are transparent allegories for inks, and that Ettery is an embodiment of knowledge pinned to paper - to her mingled delight and dismay. The author only half-commits to the metaphor, though, and is clearly at least as interested in titillation as revelation.
