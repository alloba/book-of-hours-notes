# Skin of Silver

## Description
Skin of Silver

The epic of the final battle of the [[Lionsmith]] with the remnant-giant [[Antaios]].
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

As always, the [[Lionsmith]] drew his strength from metal, and Antaios from stoneâ€¦ but the Lionsmith began to suspect also that this time, Antaios was drawing power from the Moon.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The Lionsmith beseeches the Three for their assistance, and the [[Meniscate]] favours him with a skin of silver, like water, like mercury, so he too can drink power from the [[Moon]]; for, she whispers, he too will one day be drawn into a perfect balance.
