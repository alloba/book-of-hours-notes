# On What is Contained By Silver

## Description
On What is Contained By Silver

A dire bestiary of the horrors to be found in mirrors. This is a recent edition of a third century text by '[[Poemander]]'.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Poemander engages in a considerable and pedantic discussion about the particular mirror-alloys that attract particular danger from particular entities. This is less useful, of course, in an era where most mirrors are silvered glass.
### Study Complete Description

'The virgins/maidens of the mirror favour orchids. The [behindlings?] favour the rhododendron. Cut flowers of either nature should not be placed before polished bronze.'
