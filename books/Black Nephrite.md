# Black Nephrite

## Description
Black Nephrite

One of Valentine Dewulf's dream-journals, in which he records his visions of 'a place that is no place, beneath the house that is no house.'
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The dark, inchoate, feral space described by Valentine seems to be the '[[Nowhere]]' of the Invisible Arts - the infra-oneiric lair of the alien Hours sometimes called gods-from-Nowhere.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Valentine's attitude to the [[Nowhere]]-Hours is unexpectedly relaxed. He speaks darkly of their appetites, but he insists they are too alien to penetrate the [[world-at-large/The Mansus|House of the Sun]], let alone the waking world. He even seems to suggest that the Mansus-Hours have exaggerated the threat of the Nowhere-Hours for their own reasons. 'Not all Birds are trustworthy in their Feathers', he warns.
