# The Tantra of Worms

## Description
The Tantra of Worms

The entomologist Juliana Zawistowski eventually came to insist that this text was written by insects inhabiting a human skin. She never presented evidence for her claim.. There are diagrams. The diagrams are not good to look upon.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The Tantra explains various less than practical countermeasures against the Worms, the 'Serpents Which Are Not Serpents'. Moth and Winter are closest to them, and so understand their weaknesses, but both have their own perils. The [[Lionsmith]] crushes them, but that's not recommended for mortals.
### Study Complete Description

'The Worms have always been eager to inhabit us. Here are the practices which make us inhospitable to them.' There are diagrams. The diagrams are not good to look upon, and none of the practices they show would allow the subject to survive.
