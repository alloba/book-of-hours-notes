# The Morphy Codex

## Description
The Morphy Codex

A priestess of the [[Sisterhood of the Triple Knot]] claims to have discerned the true meaning of the [[Thunderskin]]'s birth.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The writer credits the Red Grail, the Ring-Yew and the Horned-Axe - the powers the Sisterhood reveres - with agreeing a final treaty between the Hours of the House and the Hours they'd displaced: the Thunderskin loved the Yew, and the Grail destroyed him, as restitution for the slaying of the Horned-Axe's sisters and brothers.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The Thunderskin entered [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]] through the Peacock Door, 'a privilege never given to the Witch-and-Sister: but then their merit was much less'. The writer admits that entry through the Peacock Door is unseemly, but insists that under the circumstances, there was no other way.
