# Singlefoot Songs

## Description
Singlefoot Songs

Father Stanislav John Schaller, priest and diplomat, writes of his time on the slopes of Huashan - 'near to the Grove of the Green Immortals, but never too near.'
### Partial Study Description

Schaller's relations with the Grove are cautious - it's a Library of the Tree, but under the hand of the Hour named Applebright. In time, however, Schaller comes to be more sympathetic to the Applebright, which he suggests 'causes harm only when so invited.'
### Study Complete Description

The 'Singlefoots' of the title are one-horned, one-footed hill-things with sweet but powerful voices - powerful enough to 'open the mountain.' The Singlefoots sometimes trample pilgrims; sometimes heal them; sometimes coerce them to 'enter the mountain' and become Singlefoots. Schaller explains that when he found this last becoming too tempting, he decided to return to his homeland.
