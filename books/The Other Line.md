# The Other Line

## Description

### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The Lords Proverbial and Lords Disquisitional war in the streets of Clarity, while the Punctuants get drunk on ink and supply the jokes (though, by Savage's usual standards, there aren't very many jokes.)
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The final act sees the Lords Proverbial unsealing the City Clarity's gate to expel the population into the unknown. (The formula that they use for the unsealing is a real one - it can be used with Knock and Preliminal Meter to create a gate-sign of power.)
