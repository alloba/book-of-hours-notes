# In the Malleary

## Description
In [[The Malleary]]

A lively account of the creation of each jewel at the world's beginning.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Lively, yes; but also almost entirely nonsense. 'Pearl, the tears of the forgotten moon, caught by the [[Lionsmith]] in his net. Ruby, the blood of the first bird, stung by the Lionsmith's hammer.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The author is either terribly misinformed of the nature of the Hours, or - one begins to suspect - intentionally throwing up a smoke-screen to confuse seekers of the Invisible Arts. But there are some useful crumbs of fact to be picked out of the daft and gaping cracks.
