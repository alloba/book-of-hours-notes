# De Motu Corporum Vetitorum

## Description
De motu corporum vetitorum

The author rejoices in the name of 'Abelard Hubris', and the title might be translated as 'On the Forbidden Motions of Bodies' - evidently a reference to Newton's 'De Motu Corporem', published some twenty years previously.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Hubris's thesis: that stars, planets and other bodies are the proxies or even essences of the Hours, and that conjunctions and occlusions reveal the outcome of Hour-intrigues in the Mansus.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Hubris declares that the Great Comet of 1577 was the physical embodiment of the Hour named [[Madrugad]]; that It disintegrated but its fragments gravitate to bone-marrow, where they can be located even now. He insists that Ouranoscopic techniques can be used with Essential Periost and sufficient Winter to create a 'talisman gerifugic'.
