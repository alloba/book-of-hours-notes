# On Imperfections

## Description
On Imperfections

Poemander, light-smith and Lantern-long, describes the process of 'transinhabitation', which he calls 'a manifestation of imperfection.'
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Lantern-long lack bodies, and so cannot normally leave the Mansus - but they can 'steady-glint' in the physical world by establishing a 'road of glass'. Poemander notes with disgust that the order of Long called the Obliviates refer to it as 'scrining', which he considers a 'debased term'.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Poemander explains the benefits of transinhabitation - that a Lantern-long can affect the senses and thoughts of those nearby, that they can even enter their spirits, and that they can 'employ the senses of those inhabited to experience again the scent of blossom and season'. This seems to be what interests him most. He insists that a Lantern-long should only ever inhabit a mirror of silver, not silvered glass, but he declines to explain why.
