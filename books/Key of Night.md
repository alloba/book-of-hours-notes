# Key of Night

## Description
Key of Night

The deliberations leading to a manifesto of the 'Worms of a Scale', as recorded around 1900 in the Bar Vienna, in the cellar of the Hotel Ciervo in Noon.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The Worms, all of whom use grandiose <i>noms de guerre</i> like Citizen Knife and the Midnight Pilgrim, agree that all previous iterations of their movement have been feckless and treacherous, and agree that the return of the prehuman Hours - the gods-from-stone - is the true way to end 'the tyranny of Eternity.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The Worms identify the Wheel, the Tide, the Flint, Sulochana, the Spider Door, the Excellency Gnathobasis and Wickel Inextinguishable as the Seven Necessary Pentiments that must be 'returned to every History through the Propaganda of the Deed'. This is an eccentric list and clearly a compromise; the process of thrashing it out clearly exhausts all the participants, who don't specify the necessary Deed beyond a vague reference to 'the Loopholes'.
