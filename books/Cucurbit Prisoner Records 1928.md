# Cucurbit Prisoner Records 1928

## Description
Cucurbit Prisoner Records 1928

Accounts by Governor Collers' private secretary of interventions and experiments in the last years of the Cucurbit prison, focusing particularly on the 'hill-children', wild Wood-things that have found a shape in the physical world.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Something called a 'Singlefoot', a horned mountain-dweller, is brought back from some kind of embassy to the Grove of Green Immortals. Collers expresses his irritation that [[Gervinus Van Lauren]] refuses to assist in its containment.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The Singlefoot somehow conjures an earthquake that cracks the tower and enables its escape. Collers determines that it should not have been permitted to dream while kept beneath the earth: it had access to sufficient Scale aspect to use its 'arts of Hill and Hollow' to develop an Old Moment into an Earthquake Name. He mandates above-ground confinement for all hill-children prisoners in the future.
