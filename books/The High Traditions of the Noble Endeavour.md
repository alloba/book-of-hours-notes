# The High Traditions of the Noble Endeavour

## Description
The High Traditions of the Noble Endeavour

A blandly positive work on the Endeavour Club, published by the Endeavour Club. The Club was founded in 1862 but claims to draw from much older traditions.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Club members are assigned names out of noble myth - 'Jaufre', 'Roland', and, unexpectedly, 'Breadbeddel'. They claim to be heirs to the Leashed Flame, which gave the island of Britain such appalling power in some histories.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Their 'Endeavour' itself is a purifying fire which makes its fuel something more than human. This transformation, however, is no longer encouraged by the Club, and perhaps - the work is coy on this - no longer permitted.
