# The Rose of Waznei

## Description
The Rose of Waznei

The heretical teachings of a disgraced offshoot of the [[Sisterhood of the Triple Knot]], that arcane-contemplative order that existed in all histories. This was recorded by 'Waznei', and dedicated to St Respicius.
### Partial Study Description

The offshoot favoured by Waznei - 'the True Sisterhood' - followed St Respicius in pursuing ascension in the name of the Door-in-the-Eye, the merciless Hour of light. St Respicius failed, perhaps because the larger Sisterhood tracked him down and ritually strangled him, but Waznei outlines steps for those who hope to succeed.
