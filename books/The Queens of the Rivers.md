# The Queens of the Rivers

## Description
The Queens of the Rivers

A surreal contemporary play by the enigmatic Monica Medina, in which the Queens of the Rivers are murdered, one by one.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The Queen of the Vistula is poisoned. The Queen of the Dnieper chokes on a fish-hook. The Queen of the Tagus is burnt alive...
### Study Complete Description

The culprit, it transpires, is the audience. The surviving Queens are directed to execute whatever audience members do not escape. A surprisingly lucid epilogue suggests that the correspondence of river-names with historical events does provide clues to secret histories behind our own.
