## Description
Seven Faces of Icarus

In the early 1530s, the last Abbot of [[St Brandan's]], called 'Roaring Richard', set down his conversations with the illiterate local cunning-man, [[Red William]].

[[Red William]] describes the seven forms in which he 'goes about and under the world' - viper, cat, fox, eagle, dove, boar and crow. Abbot Richard ingeniously fits these all into a framework of Solar beliefâ€¦

According to [[Abbot Richard]], each of Red William's forms is closer to the Sun, and is increasingly 'winged with virtue'. Richard draws an analogy with the waxen wings of Icarus: hypocrisy and false virtue will melt before the Sun's heat, and so sincerity and untrammelled expression of the Self are the utmost piety. It's worth noting that only a year or two after Richard wrote this book, [[John Tregonwell]] was so appalled by the debaucheries of the monks of St Brandan's that he recommended the monastery's immediate dissolution.
