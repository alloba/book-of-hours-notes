Fekri is a keen fisherman, and speaks glowingly of the fish suppers of Brancrug. He also admits that his enthusiasm for 'the bounty of the sea' has altered him - that before he came to Brancrug, he consumed only those things found in the earth. 'I was the greater thereby, but all of us give up what we were, to become what we are.'
