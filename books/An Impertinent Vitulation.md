# An Impertinent Vitulation

## Description
An Impertinent Vitulation

A book of kitchen-garden techniques and aphrodisiac recipes recorded by [[Ernestine Peterhans]], the 'Iron Seneschale' of Hush House for three generations of Dewulfs.

Peterhans mentions that one of these Leaves & Thorns techniques, with sufficient Nectar aspect, can supposedly cause 'a marvellous copper fruit' to burst from wood, although she has never managed it herself - but in a 'certain season' the pear-trees in the Practic Garden will deliver something similar.
