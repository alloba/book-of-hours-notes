# The Larquebine Codex

## Description
The Larquebine Codex

Christoph Larquebus claimed to have purchased two hand-written copies of the Codex from a family of witches on the shores of the Sea of Marmara. A third was 'given to the Sea'.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The [[Sister-and-Witch]] came from the West, where they were born in two wombs, one a princess, one a monster. Nevertheless they loved each other from birth, and met in secret 'to seek union'.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

When the great drought came, the kings of that land tried to sacrifice the princess and the witch, so they sailed across the Sea. When despair took them, they flung themselves into the drowning waters... and so found the Painted River, where they entered [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]] through the offices of the Red Grail. Nevertheless, the Codex ends with a condemnation of the Grail.
