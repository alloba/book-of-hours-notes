# The Writing on the Wall

## Description
The Writing on the Wall

The most delicious traditions of the Carapace Cross, as recorded on the walls of the Mansus and transcribed into a book of ninety-nine pages by one known only as 'cc'. Although this book does not exist, it is read to a sleeper under certain very specific circumstances - and certain fragments jotted down on waking. [This 'book' houses a <i>numen</i> - a truth so powerful it can perhaps believe itself.]
