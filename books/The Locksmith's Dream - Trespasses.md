# The Locksmith's Dream - Trespasses

## Description
The Locksmith's Dream: Trespasses

The third volume of [[Teresa Galmier]]'s examination of parallels in the mystic dreams of artisans.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

In this volume, notoriously, Galmier's prose begins to disintegrate, and it is not clear which dreams are in fact her own.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

'The woman in the sand-coloured robe has told me: the stairways of [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]] go ever up. Death is down. The [[Mother of Ants]] guards both directions with each of her heads, and so the passage must always be through a wound. I think [[The White Door]] might be a wound. That's one reason the Dead sometimes pass it. I think I have the other half of the Secret now, and I hope my reader can put both halves together.'
