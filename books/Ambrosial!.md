# Ambrosial!

## Description
Ambrosial!

Ambrose Westcott's inventive - one might say pioneering, or indeed buccaneering - essays into kitchencraft.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Westcott proudly announces his intention to transform cuisine to become 'an Engine of Alchemy, a Fount of War.'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Westcott describes the ferocity of fire with the intensity of appetite as 'in essence, one essence'. A fire's ability to transform and destroy grows when it is offered the correct fuel; so too, he implies, can a sufficiently inspired appetite allow its possessor to consume 'greatly, strangely, unwisely.'
