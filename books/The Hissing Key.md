# The Hissing Key

## Description
The Hissing Key

An account of the ascent of the Hour called the [[Mother of Ants]], by the Bosk-scholar Mek, of the Theban branch of the House of Lethe.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Mek is not sympathetic to the [[Mother of Ants]], who he calls 'the Milk-Thief'. He reviles her for her part in the death of the [[Seven-Coils]], which he presents as a treacherous conspiracy.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The Milk-Thief conspires with the Ligeian Echidna and the Hour-to-be called Chiliarch (now more generally rendered as 'Colonel') to unseam the [[Seven-Coils]] with feathers and drown her in salt. The Colonel thus ascends to Hour status; the jealous Milk-Thief, once the Colonel's priestess, seduces Echidna into lending her the Hissing Key to enter the Mansus through the Savage Door, beginning her own ascent to Name and ultimately Hour.
