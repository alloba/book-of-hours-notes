# Sunset Passages

## Description
Sunset Passages

A miscellany of the funerary prayers, ceremonies and hymns of the Church of the Unconquered Sun, which was ascendant in the Third and Fourth Histories. It schismed during the Intercalate, when the Sun was divided, and has not survived as a significant force.
### Partial Study Description

The Church revered the [[Sun-In-Splendour]] before it was divided -but even while it was still whole, its later selves were recognised as its Names. The [[Madrugad]], of course, presided over death and the passage into the House.
### Study Complete Description

The White Ceremony was spoken to honour the Madrugad, at funerals held in the chilly space before dawn. The text cautions that all blades should remain sheathed while the Ceremony is spoken, 'lest the corpse be not quiet.'
