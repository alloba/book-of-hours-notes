# It is Written

## Description
It Is Written

Musgrave, fourth of the Dewulf line, writes tentatively about the 'Covenant of Brancrug' and the legacy of the sacred inks he calls 'encausta potentialia'.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

'As the Light passeth through a Prism into many Colours, so the Great Inks separateth into the Lesser Inks, and the Lesser Inks into Inks Minorâ€¦'
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

Musgrave coyly refuses to talk of the Great Inks (or else refuses to admit he doesn't know much about them). He insist that yewgall and stargall, which can be mixed with sufficient Nectar or Sky aspect, are sufficient for 'most befitting Purposes'.
