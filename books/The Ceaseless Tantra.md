# The Ceaseless Tantra

## Description
The Ceaseless Tantra

The avant-garde choreographer Nicholas Keirle supposedly incorporated this Tantra into his menacing ballets.
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

The Ceaseless Tantra is devoted mostly to warnings about the lively creatures called Percussigants, but concludes with a chant which can be used to summon them. It observes that Percussigants can be taught any dance, but they prefer only one.
