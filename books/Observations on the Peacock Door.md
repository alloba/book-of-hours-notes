# Observations on the Peacock Door

## Description
Observations on the Peacock Door

Ninegala of Lagash discusses the Peacock Door, the highest door available to mortals in [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]]: 'a rent, an imperfection, an abrasion.'
### Partial Study Description
I'm Reading...

Notably, the book is written in Vak, which by some accounts is another aspect of the Peacock Door itself. Ninegala addresses this by apologising courteously to the Door, and the language, at the end of every section.
### Study Complete Description
I've Read...

The Peacock Door did not exist - Ninegala says - in the days when the gods-from-stone entered the Mansus. They used the 'Fanged Key' to open the Savage Door, a door not usually available to mortals. 'Speech, as the initiates of [[Chione]] would have it, is a wound. I fear that through that wound, the blood of the Mansus flows even now, and that one day Speech will be an end to Dream. I fear that; but I fear the alternative far more.'
