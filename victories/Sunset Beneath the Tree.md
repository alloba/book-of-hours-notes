# Description
Sunset Beneath the Tree

Hush House lives again. Perhaps that's all I want. Some of the very best Librarians have worked well, lived quietly, left the world a better place...
[This will end your game. Ambitious Librarians might prefer to keep looking for another victory. Contented librarians understand that to restore the House, and find the Tree, is victory enough. Or, of course, you could choose this ending any time you like - and begin again with another Librarian.]
