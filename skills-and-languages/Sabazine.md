# Sabazine

## Description
Sabazine

There is a History where Alexander defeated first the Great Knot of Sabazos, and then the King of Kings. There is another History where, instead, he learnt from them. How many more? If we curl our hands into the correct shapes, we may yet understand.

### Birdsong I
The Fisher's Tale

There's a story told by fisherfolk, about a city of amber and orichalcum that lies behind the waves. Those who eat of its fruits can breathe water and drink light, but they can never drink anything else afterwards. Only in another History, they say; but if you tie your nets right, you might just catch one of its citizens in this History, and they might just tell you the way.

### Horomachistry II
The Sailor's Tale

There's a story told by sailors, about a city of ivory and iron across the sea. Those who come there never die, but those who leave again have never lived. Only in another History, they say; but if you rig your sails right, you might just catch the wind that takes you there in this one.
