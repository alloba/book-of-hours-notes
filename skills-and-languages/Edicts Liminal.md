# Edicts Liminal

## Description
Edicts Liminal

The precepts of limitation and division; established by the enigmatic conclave of Hours sometimes called the Chancel.
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Skolekosophy II
Scolecite

There is a prophecy of a glorious City that mortals could raise, but the Hours of the Chancel have decreed that it will not exist. The decrees of the Chancel are not defied, but now and then they have been circumventedâ€¦ and we might conceive that City with walls of shining scolecite could be raised [[Nowhere]]; in the darkness below dreams. This would be Skolekosophy.
