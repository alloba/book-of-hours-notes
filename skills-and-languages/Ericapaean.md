# Ericapaean

## Description
Ericapaean

A language of surpassing beauty and allusiveness, revealed through the ecstatic apprehensions of the Orphics, the Eleusinians, and the Sibyls of the Rhine. Ericapaean, these mystics claimed, allows the elaboration of hues, sensations and states of mind too subtle for grosser tongues.
