# Watchman's Paradoxes

## Description
Watchman's Paradoxes

'That amber preserves and is preserved by light; that to hatch is not to die; that the Sun.' There is a place behind the world called [[world-at-large/The Mansus|the Mansus]]. Deeds that would be impossible in the world are inevitable there. The Watchman, who knows all the ways of the Mansus, also knows how to make these deeds possible in the waking world.
