A Temple

The seven tainted immortals we call [[Ligeians]] are relentless in their appetite, and outcast under the laws of heaven. But they have their uses to the Hours. The Ligeian Echidna learnt her shaping arts in the world's dawn, and even now the Lionsmith values her skill; so every year they meet in the desert, among the furnace shadows of the Seven-Coiled temple, to share their knowledge of how monsters were made.
