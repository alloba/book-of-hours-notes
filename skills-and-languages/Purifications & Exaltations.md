# Purifications & Exaltations

## Description
Purifications & Exaltations

'No-one ever truly wants to be truly changed. Azoth and refulgin are justly feared. But no-one who has been changed would choose to go back.' - George Collers
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Ithastry I
The Tree

Never underestimate the Hour named Madrugad. Foolish adepts deride her as an Hour of ashes. What do they think the Watchman's Tree sprang from? Fire purifies; light exalts.
