# Wolf Stories

## Description
Wolf Stories

Sometimes we eat the wolf, and sometimes the wolf eats us.
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Birdsong VII
The Wolf's Return

The Sanctioned Version of the Book of Suns says that the Wolf-Divided was awoken by the Sun's division. We know from this that the Wolf was its own Hour even when the Sun was whole. So we glean and we guess that the Sun might be healed, and the Wolf return to its slumbers. So we glean and guess that a Second Dawn would bring peace, but the Wolf will fight to prevent it. This is Birdsong.
