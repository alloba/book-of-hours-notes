# Resurgences & Emergences

## Description
Resurgences & Emergences

Birth and death are only directions. Between the two we find a crossroads.

Moth and Grail

The gods-from-Stone made a law that the keys of dream cannot be held or owned. The time of Stone is past, but the keys remain. So the holders of these keys can only be the seven Ligeians, whose crime has set them outside the law. And the Ligeians serve an Hour of Moth and Grail: when the last remnants of the gods-from-Stone are renewed, the law will be renewed with them. Preservation is the wisdom of renewal.
