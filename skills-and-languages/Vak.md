# Vak

## Description
Vak

Before gods arose from blood, before ever ape stood upright, this was the language heard in the House of the Sun.... 'I am Vak,' the Peacock Door boasted, 'both the tongue and the Goddess. I am the only entrance into secret light. I was worshipped before you upright apes, and I will be still when all of you are ugly ash. Listen, and I will prove it.

An Opportunity

Something not commonly understood: were there no Calyptra to conceal perilous knowledge, there could be no Vak. A door opens both ways. This is understood by scholars of the Arts Unregarded.
