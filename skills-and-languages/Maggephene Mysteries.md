## Description
Maggephene Mysteries

'The greater plagues may not be cured, only bound. The very greatest of all may only be entreatedâ€¦ and it is death to do so improperly.'

Revenge

The gods-who-are, which we call the Hours, warred against the gods-from-stone and cast them down. What remains of the gods-from-stone we call plague, scourge, catastrophe. If the Hours were cast down in their turn, would the gods-from-stone be satisfied? Would revenge bring peace? The Night Arts hint that it might be so.
