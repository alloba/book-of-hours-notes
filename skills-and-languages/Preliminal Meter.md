# Preliminal Meter

## Description
Preliminal Meter

'Nine modes, nine horizons': the subtle rhythms of words which open ways.
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Illumination I
Of Keys

One of us passed the Summit. One may not.
Two of us sought the Lantern. Two chose flight.
The seventh rarely named, but not forgot.

 This is Illumination.
