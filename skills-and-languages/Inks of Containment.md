# Inks of Containment

## Description
Inks of Containment

The inks in which the Histories are preserved.
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Preservation IV
When It Is Safe

Certain knowledge is forbidden to mortalsâ€¦ except in nine great libraries protected by the covenant-stones they hold, where this knowledge can be safely recorded in the inks called <i>encaustum terminale</i>. These libraries are together called the Watchman's Tree, and the covenant marked by these stones shares that name. All this, then, is a matter of Preservation.
