# Pearl & Tide

## Description
Pearl & Tide

The depths of the sea, the waves upon the shore, and the memories of their withdrawal.
## Tree of Wisdom Entries
### Nyctodromy I

The Sea: whale-road, salt-realm, moon-way. Anything given to the waves may find another home - unless its home is the Sea. Nyctodromy shows us the way across the sea, and the way home.
